07x01,Ted (2030),"Kids, if there’s one big theme to this story, and I swear, we’re totally, almost, not really all that close to the end… it’s timing. Timing is everything. For example, I never would’ve met your mother if it weren't for a wedding. The last wedding I ever thought I'd be at."
07x01,Unknown,Ted enters a room where Barney is looking at himself in the mirror.
07x01,Barney,What do you think of this tie?
07x01,Ted,"Oh, thank God. Barney Stinson needs you right before his wedding, you assume there's at least one dead hooker in the closet, right?"
07x01,Barney,Is this one better?
07x01,Ted,"Look, the tie is great, and, you know, it's perfectly normal to have some pre-wedding jitters."
07x01,Barney,"I'm not having jitters. It just occurs to me that once I put this tie on, I can never take it off. I have to wear this tie forever and ever. And sure, this tie's skinny now, but what happens if it gets fat and starts bossing me around? Did I make a mistake? Would I have been happier with the other tie? Ted, can I tell you a big secret?"
07x01,Ted,"Yeah, of course."
07x01,Barney,I'm not really talking about the tie.
07x01,Ted,"No, I got that, Barney."
07x01,Barney,I wonder if this whole thing's a disaster. What if this is the worst wedding ever?
07x01,Ted,Not possible. We've already been to the worst wedding ever.
07x01,Barney,Punchy's wedding.
07x01,Ted,Marshall really took a two-flusher on that one.
07x01,Ted (2030),The story of how Uncle Marshall ruined my friend Punchy’s wedding starts in September 2011.
07x01,Unknown,September 2011...
07x01,Ted (2030),Punchy had asked me to be his best man.
07x01,Unknown,"Barney, Robin, Marshall and Lily join Ted at McLaren's."
07x01,Everyone,Hey!
07x01,Ted,"Hey. Guys, before we go, would you mind reading my wedding toast?"
07x01,Everyone,"Oh, yeah, no problem. Sure."
07x01,Barney,If we have to.
07x01,Ted,All right.
07x01,Unknown,Ted pulls out a thick binder.
07x01,Barney,Whoa.
07x01,Ted,There’s a few different versions.
07x01,Robin,"Ted, why are you working so hard on this toast? Punchy belched his proposal through a karaoke mic at a bowling alley."
07x01,Ted,"Okay, look, I've never told you guys this, but over the years, a few of my old high school buddies have asked me to give wedding toasts, and they haven't gone great."
07x01,Unknown,Flashback
07x01,Unknown,In 2008...
07x01,Ted,Somehow those weddings all fell smack-dab in the worst moments of my life.
07x01,Ted’s toast 2008,Joel and Mora's love is a beautiful thing. I thought I had that... till my fiancée left me
07x01,Unknown,"at the altar last week. I was asked not to talk about this, so I won't. I sit outside her house at night sometimes. She got a haircut."
07x01,Ted’s toast 2009,"After I lost my job last week, uh, I was asked not to give this toast..."
07x01,Unknown,"One of the guys at the table tries to take away Ted’s mic, but Ted refuses to give it to him."
07x01,Ted’s toast continues,"No, no, no! The happy couple needs to hear this. Things end. But from the ashes of your statistically probable divorce, hope can rise anew. (sniffles) That is why I'm starting my own architecture firm--Mosbius Designs."
07x01,Unknown,Three months later…
07x01,Ted,"Mosbius Designs has failed. But Alex and Jessica's love reminds us that...That… (sobbing) Oh, God!"
07x01,Punchy,Classic Schmosby.
07x01,Unknown,End flashback
07x01,Robin,Whoa. Punchy posted the low points of your life online?
07x01,Ted,"Oh, not just that."
07x01,Unknown,Classic Shmosby Remix starts playing.
07x01,Unknown,♪ Mosbius Designs has failed ♪
07x01,Unknown,♪ But Alex and Jessica's love
07x01,Unknown,reminds us that... ♪
07x01,Unknown,♪ Tha-tha-tha-tha-tha... ♪
07x01,Unknown,"Oh, God!"
07x01,Ted,So now I seem like a total train wreck to all my old high school friends. And a bunch of people in Finland. The auto-tune thing got kind of big over there. That's why I have to nail this toast.
07x01,Barney,"Ted, you want to nail something at this wedding-- lose the Trapper Keeper. The only thing you need to bring to Cleveland is this."
07x01,Unknown,Barney shows everyone a magazine with Ted on the cover.
07x01,Ted (2030),That fall I became the youngest architect in the history of New York to break ground on a skyscraper. Which led to a glowing magazine feature. I planned on having it framed--Uncle Barney had different plans.
07x01,Barney,"Here's your toast -- ""Single file, ladies. No fatties"""""
07x01,Ted,That's ridiculous.
07x01,Barney,"Yeah, you're right. It’s Cleveland. ""Single file, ladies"""""
07x01,Unknown,Theme song starts.
07x01,Ted,I'm not going to Punchy's wedding to brag about a magazine...cover.
07x01,Robin,"Barney, he doesn't need dating advice from you. You never even called Nora."
07x01,Unknown,Flashback
07x01,Ted (2030),"Kids, you remember Nora. But just the other day..."
07x01,Barney,I'll call you.
07x01,Nora,"It's never too late, Barney."
07x01,Unknown,End flashback
07x01,Robin,Or did you call her? Not that I care. Did you? I don't care. Did you?
07x01,Barney,I haven't called her.
07x01,Robin,"Damn it, Barney. I was really, really, really rooting for you two. Who wants hot wings?"
07x01,Lily,"I’m in. Or maybe we should just pour hot sauce on Barney, since he's a total chicken."
07x01,Barney,"I did not chicken out. Nora is looking for something serious. I'm not. End of story. And yes, Robin, I would love some wings."
07x01,Lily,Cannibal.
07x01,Robin,"Okay, next round's on me."
07x01,Marshall and Lily,"Oh, no, we got it!!"
07x01,Ted (2030),Now Lily and Marshall had just found out they were having a baby.
07x01,Unknown,Flashback
07x01,Unknown,Lily and Marshall argue in their room.
07x01,Marshall,I can't wait to tell everyone.
07x01,Lily,"Baby, no, we can't tell anyone. Not until three months. I don't want to jinx it."
07x01,Marshall,"That's a bit superstitious, don't you think?"
07x01,Lily,"Whenever we board a flight, you lick the plane."
07x01,Marshall,Have we crashed even once?
07x01,Lily,Don't say a word until we know everything's okay. Deal?
07x01,Marshall,Deal. But everything's just going to be great. I promise.
07x01,Lily,How can you guarantee that?
07x01,Unknown,Marshall uncovers Lily’s belly and kisses it.
07x01,Marshall,Come here.
07x01,Unknown,End flashback
07x01,Marshall,I'm just so happy. I don't know how we're going to keep this secret for three months.
07x01,Lily,Relax. It will be easy.
07x01,Bartender,What'll you have?
07x01,Lily,"Four beers, plus one non-alcoholic."
07x01,Bartender,You're pregnant! Get in here!
07x01,Unknown,Bartender hugs Lily.
07x01,Ted (2030),And so we all headed to my hometown where we planned to celebrate Punchy's big day. Uncle Barney had different plans.
07x01,Barney,"Get ready, Cleveland. The last man to screw you this hard then disappear was LeBron James."
07x01,Robin,You're trying to get laid here?
07x01,Barney,What?
07x01,Robin,"God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between Ted's annoying friend and what's-her-face. Have some respect."
07x01,Barney,"This isn't just getting laid. This is market research. You see, my legendary"
07x01,Unknown,success rate of 83%...
07x01,Ted (to Robin),17%-- it's always the inverse.
07x01,Barney (continues),...doesn't happen by accident. Every single play I run on women has been
07x01,Unknown,"meticulously field-tested. By weeding out the bad plays in smaller markets like Cleveland, I know which ones will work in New York. For example, tonight marks the inaugural flight of the “escaped manslaughterer”. Are escaped manslaughterers sexy?"
07x01,Everyone,"No, no. Not even remotely."
07x01,Barney,Exactly. We'll never know unless I try it out tonight.
07x01,Punchy,Schmosby! Turd-faces! What's up?!
07x01,Unknown,He punches everyone’s arm jokingly.
07x01,Marshall,You really feel that ring now.
07x01,Kelly,So glad you all made it.
07x01,Punchy,"Open bar. Drink up, turd-faces, 'cause Kelly's dad's paying for all this, and he hates my guts."
07x01,Kelly,It's true.
07x01,Punchy,"Who's doing sh*ts? Come on, let's go."
07x01,Lily,"Oh, no, thank you."
07x01,Punchy,"What, are you pregnant or somethin’?"
07x01,Lily,"Let’s get hammered! (Turns to Marshall and whispers) You're drinking for two tonight, baby."
07x01,Marshall,(solemnly) I will do this for the child.
07x01,Kelly and Punchy,Go Browns!
07x01,Marshall,"In AFC regular season play, but if they mean the Super Bowl, go Vikings."
07x01,Lily,Yowza!
07x01,Unknown,Woman runs away screaming and Barney shows up at the bar.
07x01,Barney,"Escaped manslaughterers-- not sexy. Although in hindsight, that was kind of a flawed concept. Next up, “Patient Zero”."
07x01,Robin,"Lily, we are getting sloshed tonight."
07x01,Lily (to Marshall),"That's all you, baby."
07x01,Marshall,But that’ll be four sh*ts in with no food.
07x01,Lily,"In nine months, I'll be pushing a pumpkin-headed Eriksen baby out of my hoo-ha. I think Papa can manage a few extra cocktails."
07x01,Marshall,Well played.
07x01,Lily,Hakuna Matata!
07x01,Marshall,"I, uh, I gotta go get some air."
07x01,Ted (2030),"Kids, remember how I told you that Marshall ruined Punchy’s wedding? (Marshall stumbles close to the wedding cake) That wasn’t it."
07x01,Robin,"God, will you look at that guy. (High-pitched voice) I wish Barney were my boyfriend again. (Laughs) No, thanks."
07x01,Lily,Wait a minute. That’s your truth voice.
07x01,Robin,My what?
07x01,Lily,Whenever you're trying to pass something off as a joke but it's actually profoundly
07x01,Unknown,"true, you use that voice."
07x01,Unknown,Flashback
07x01,Unknown,Robin is watching TV with Lily.
07x01,Robin,(High-pitched voice) I wish the Spice Girls would get back together. They were awesome. (Laughs) The worst.
07x01,Unknown,"Everyone’s sitting at their regular McLaren’s table, and they all start complaining about a smell. It looks like someone had farted."
07x01,Robin,(High-pitched voice) That was me. I totally cut one. (Snorts) It was…that guy.
07x01,Unknown,They are all sitting on Ted’s couch.
07x01,Robin,Birthday present from my dad. (High-pitched voice) All I really want is for him to tell me that he loves me. (Snorts) Just kidding. This pen's enough. (High-pitched voice) It's not enough. (Chuckles) It's totally enough.
07x01,Lily,"Oh, my God. You still have feelings for Barney. Admit it, you still have feelings for Barney."
07x01,Unknown,End flashback
07x01,Robin,"You are drunker than I thought. I mean, look at the guy."
07x01,Barney,"Wait, wait, wait. Before you go, please answer the following survey to help me better"
07x01,Unknown,bang you in the future. What didn't work for you about this play? Did you A) not believe I was a Guinness Book world record holder? or B) did the fingernails gross you out? (Barney pulls out his extremely long fingernails from under the table.)
07x01,Man,"Can’t wait for your toast, Schmosby."
07x01,Punchy,"Yeah, here come the waterworks. (Mock sobbing)"
07x01,Ted,Wait. You're rooting for me to melt down at your own wedding?
07x01,Punchy,"Yeah, everyone is. Plus a few new friends from Finland. Good luck, Schmos. Good luck! Good luck!"
07x01,Barney,"Take it. Shows them how awesome you are. Shamelessly plug yourself, so you can shamelessly plug, let's say that."
07x01,Ted,"I told you, I'm not here to brag, okay?"
07x01,Marshall,"That's it. You’re too polite to brag. Well, fine. Let me. Because the only person"
07x01,Unknown,"on Earth who loves Ted Mosby more than Marshall Eriksen, is drunk Marshall Eriksen. So, game on."
07x01,Ted (2030),"Kids, remember how I told you Marshall ruined Punchy and Kelly’s wedding? That wasn’t it either."
07x01,Robin,Barney and I tried and failed. That was two years ago. Why would I ever go down that road again? It wouldn't even make sense.
07x01,Lily,"It doesn't have to make sense. It's chemistry. Look, I've always had a sixth sense about these things. And now that I'm pregnant... with this idea in my mind-uterus, I see things"
07x01,Unknown,even clearer. You and Barney have the kind of chemistry that just doesn't go away.
07x01,Robin,Really? That's why is he trying to LeBron anything that moves?
07x01,Barney,"Did this not work for you because A) vampires are played out, or B) claiming that I also"
07x01,Unknown,invented Facebook was kind of a hat on a hat?
07x01,Lily,You're the reason he never called Nora. You're the reason he's only test-marketing tonight. And you're the reason he keeps striking out on purpose. Chemistry.
07x01,Marshall,"Wow! Ted! Is that really you on the cover of New York magazine? Now, you say ""yes."""
07x01,Ted,"Please, stop."
07x01,Man,Schmosby. What's this about a magazine?
07x01,Ted,"You know what, Clay? It's no big deal."
07x01,Marshall,"You know what? It is a big deal. Clay, my friend Ted is designing a skyscraper, Clay. What have you been up to, Clay?"
07x01,Clay,"Well, I'm still working at the rental car company..."
07x01,Marshall,"Bravo, bravo, Clay. Any major publications want to write an article on your sweet rental car gig?"
07x01,Clay,"No, no articles. My life’s pretty dull. I guess the only news is this little gal."
07x01,Marshall,"Oh my God, wook at the wittle baby. She's so cute. All I want to do is put her little feet in my mouth. You’ve created something truly beautiful."
07x01,Clay,She is my everything.
07x01,Ted,"I mean, it's kind of a big deal... the building, you know?"
07x01,Marshall,"Hey, little one. (With another couple and their child...) So this little angel is already sleeping through the night?"
07x01,Ted,"I've had some sleepless nights...designing this building. (Baby spits directly onto the magazine, on Ted’s face.) Nothing symbolic about that."
07x01,Robin,Let it go. There is no chemistry left between me and Barney. We're done.
07x01,Lily,Oh really? Prove it. Go tell him.
07x01,Robin,Why would I go tell him that?
07x01,Lily,"Because deep down, even if he isn't aware of it himself, Barney wants to be with you. And if it's not gonna happen, he deserves to know."
07x01,Robin,"Fine. (To Barney) Barney, just so everything is crystal clear..."
07x01,Barney,I know what you're gonna say. Let's show Cleveland how it's done.
07x01,Unknown,He pulls her into his arms and takes her to the dance floor. They start doing an impromptu dance choreography.
07x01,Robin,Barney... I... (Breathless)
07x01,Unknown,Barney's phone starts ringing.
07x01,Barney,"Sorry. Oh, my God, it’s Nora. Nora’s finally calling me back."
07x01,Robin,"Wait, you said you never called her."
07x01,Barney,"I lied. I called her, like, five times. Wait, wait! You of all people know how much I suck at these things. You gotta help me. Please? Just once I would like to see what it feels like to not screw things up."
07x01,Robin,Yeah. Mmm-hmm.
07x01,Barney,"Thanks for calling me back. Um, hey, hi. The-the-the reason that, um, I called is, uh..."
07x01,Robin,To tell you how I feel about you.
07x01,Barney,...to tell you how
07x01,Unknown,I feel about you.
07x01,Robin,I know we didn't work out the first time...
07x01,Barney,I know we didn't work out the first time...
07x01,Robin,...and I know it doesn't make any sense...
07x01,Barney,...and I know it doesn't make any sense...
07x01,Robin,...but I can't shake the feeling that we belong together.
07x01,Barney,...but I can't shake this feeling that we belong together.
07x01,Robin,Is there any part of you that wants to try again?
07x01,Barney,Is there any part of you that wants to try again?
07x01,Unknown,"Barney thanks Robin silently, and she walks away."
07x01,Unknown,Marshall returns to Lily with a baby in his arms.
07x01,Marshall,"Baby, I can't take it anymore. I've gotta tell somebody that we're pregnant."
07x01,Lily,"Eriksen, stay strong. We're keeping this secret."
07x01,Marshall,There are babies everywhere. It's like a minefield of cuteness. Look at this little bastard.
07x01,Lily,"Marshall, stop it. Stay strong. You can't let holding some, some little baby... oh, with the cute little cheeks and the... the little arms and little legs... This son of a b*tch has knee dimples. Let's go tell everyone I'm pregnant."
07x01,Marshall,Yeah!
07x01,Unknown,Robin goes out on the terrace and finds Ted smoking a cigar.
07x01,Ted,You okay?
07x01,Robin,Nope. You?
07x01,Ted,Not excessively. You want to talk about it?
07x01,Robin,Not even a little.
07x01,Ted,Might make you feel better.
07x01,Robin,"Okay, fine, I'll make you a deal: you go first, and then I'll stick with my thing about not talking about it."
07x01,Ted,"Okay. All my friends from high school, they're here with their wives, their kids. Me? My date for the night is a sticky magazine."
07x01,Robin,"Sounds like high school all over again. Sorry, it was right there."
07x01,Ted,"I used to believe in destiny, you know? I'd go to the bagel place, see a pretty girl in line reading my favorite novel, whistling the song that's been stuck in my head all week and I'd think, ""Wow. Hey, maybe she's the one."" Now I think, ""I just know that b*tch is gonna take the last whole-wheat everything bagel."""
07x01,Robin,You've just been focused on work.
07x01,Ted,"No, it's more than that. I've stopped believing. Not in some depressed, ""I'm gonna cry"
07x01,Unknown,"during my toast"" way. Not in a way I even noticed until tonight. It's just, every day, I think I believe a little less and a little less and a little less. And that... sucks. What do I do about that, Scherbatsky?"
07x01,Robin,You're Ted Mosby. You start believing again.
07x01,Ted,"In what, destiny?"
07x01,Robin,"Chemistry. If you have chemistry, you only need one other thing."
07x01,Ted,What's that?
07x01,Robin,Timing. But timing's a b*tch.
07x01,Ted,"Hey, we still have our 40 deal, right? If we're both still single at 40..."
07x01,Robin,"I'm all yours. Hmm. Unrelated, do architects make big money?"
07x01,Ted,Aggressively medium money.
07x01,Robin,Damn it.
07x01,Guy,"Schmosby, you're up in two minutes."
07x01,Robin,"Okay, promise me two things: One, you start believing again, and two, don't cry"
07x01,Unknown,"during the toast, Schmosby."
07x01,Ted,I promise.
07x01,Robin,Good.
07x01,Lily,We're having a baby.
07x01,Robin,"What, for real?"
07x01,Lily,For real.
07x01,"Ted, Barney and Robin",Oh! Oh!
07x01,Voices,"Attention, everyone! It's time for the reason we're all here tonight, Schmosby's toast!"
07x01,Ted,We're here tonight to celebrate love. (People laugh) Love brings us new life...
07x01,Marshall,Hey! This isn't a meltdown. These are tears of joy. Ted is happy for his friends 'cause he's the best guy that I know. And do you know why he's happy? Because this beautiful lady right here is pregnant.
07x01,Kelly,How did you know that?! That was supposed to be a secret!
07x01,Unknown,Turns out...
07x01,Kelly,Go Browns! Go Browns! Whoo! (She pretends to drink and gives it to Punchy)
07x01,Marshall,"In AFC regular season play, but if they mean the Super Bowl, go Vikings."
07x01,Kelly’s father,"How dare you. That's my daughter, you piece of garbage."
07x01,Punchy,"You're still gonna pay for all this, right?"
07x01,Punchy’s dad,"""Piece of garbage""? That's my son."
07x01,Ted (2030),And that is how Marshall destroyed Punchy's wedding. But we didn't care. There was gonna be a sixth member of our little family.
07x01,Ted,"No wedding will ever, ever be as bad as that one, right?"
07x01,Barney,"I picked the right tie, didn't I?"
07x01,Ted,"You nailed it. And hey, just be glad it's not the ducky tie."
07x01,Ted (2030),"Ooh, the ducky tie. That's a good story kids. I'll get to that. Man, we are not even close to the end."
07x01,Barney,"You're a good best man, Ted. You're gonna cry during the toast, aren't you?"
07x01,Ted,"Oh, I'm totally gonna cry."
07x01,Barney,Come in.
07x01,Lily,"Ted, the bride wants to see you."
07x01,Ted,Okay.
07x01,Lily,Really? You're gonna go with THAT tie?
07x02,Marshall,"Oh my God, guys, I still have a hangover. Did I really ruin a marriage?"
07x02,Ted,"No, you did not ruin a marriage. Only reception."
07x02,Robin,And Miztva Bar next door.
07x02,Lily,And my dress. And your dress. You put a dress at one point.
07x02,Marshall,"Ok, you know what, it's good. I'll be a father, and I want to be the kind of man that my child can watch. Therefore, new resolution... I will never drunk! I'm serious!"
07x02,Ted (2030),"Children, this is not your Uncle Marshall was a problem with the drink. But every time he was a good resolution, we knew about that..."
07x02,Unknown,Flashback
07x02,Unknown,"The day before, Marshall returned to the apartment, drunk."
07x02,Marshall,I've done it again!
07x02,Ted (2030),But I lost a bit in the story.
07x02,Unknown,End flashback
07x02,Unknown,Barney joined the others on crutches.
07x02,Lily,What happened to your leg?
07x02,Barney,"Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some ""sympathy points"". She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of ""Man of La Mancha."" What do you think?"
07x02,Ted,Lose the cast.
07x02,Barney,A one-man show... I love it!
07x02,Lily,Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?
07x02,Barney,"You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it."
07x02,Ted,"Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls."
07x02,Unknown,Flashback
07x02,Unknown,Ted is at the newsstand and a woman reads the magazine in which it appears.
07x02,Woman,Is this you?
07x02,Ted,"Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted."
07x02,Woman,Hi.
07x02,Unknown,End flashback
07x02,Lily,"That's great, Ted."
07x02,Ted,It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.
07x02,Unknown,Flashback
07x02,Unknown,Ted behind her magazine down and when a woman arrives.
07x02,Ted,"Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby. (With another woman) I plead guilty. Salvation. Ted Mosby. (And another) It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of ""An egg on my face"" magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby."

07x02,Ted,"completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both."
07x02,Unknown,Marshall's phone rings.
07x02,Marshall,"Guys, this is Garrison Cootes."
07x02,Ted (2030),"Children, Garrison Cootes was a major partner of Honeywell & Cootes. One of the largest environmental law firms in the United States.Marshall would have given anything to work there."
07x02,Marshall,"If I did not work, I could finish... in kind, a Taco Belle somewhere. And nobody wants that. Unless you want to do this, like this you would have free tacos, since you are my friends. But now I need you all calmiez! (He finally won) Hello."
07x02,Garrison,"Marshall, it's Garrison Cootes. Sorry for not having reminded you earlier but I was stuck. What's funny, because I'm literally stuck in a swamp. Well, anyway, here I am trying to collect some samples for this trial on the pollution that we are working."
07x02,Marshall,I love the work you do.
07x02,Garrison,It's a...
07x02,Marshall,"No, I mean it."
07x02,Garrison,"No, no, there is a crocodile a few meters from me. So I'll just ignore the warm urine running down my leg right now, and tell you that we are very interested in your case."
07x02,Marshall,He's interested!
07x02,Garrison,"Obviously, we need to do some sort of verification purpose, you see, an investigation of crime and a Google search, but if nothing seems wrong to us, it takes you."
07x02,Marshall,"It's fantastic, Mr Cootes!"
07x02,Garrison,"Well, I'm going. It's very funny because in fact I really have run away."
07x02,Marshall,The crocodile you saw?
07x02,Garrison,"He is coming, yes."
07x02,Unknown,GENERIC
07x02,Ted (2030),"The next night, Barney and Nora saw each other for a coffee.Fortunately, without the neck brace ridiculous."
07x02,Barney,"Hi Nora, thank you for coming."
07x02,Nora,What happened to your neck?
07x02,Barney,"My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene..."
07x02,Nora,"Wow, this one has a beautiful chest."
07x02,"Barney, turning","What? Where? Oh, and shit."
07x02,Nora,Breasts...
07x02,Barney,"Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry."
07x02,Nora,What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?
07x02,Barney,"Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them."
07x02,Unknown,Ted returned to his apartment.
07x02,Ted,"I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait... (2 minutes later...) I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is t*rture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round."
07x02,Lily,Wait a minute. You're going to handle two girls at once? You do not think you should pick one before it gets too serious?
07x02,Ted,"Define ""serious""."
07x02,Lily,"Well, it's complicated. I think it would be when you have expectations, emotional involvement..."
07x02,Marshall,"Third base. Seriously, third base."
07x02,Ted,So I can go to the second two with no problem?
07x02,Marshall,Treat yourself my friend. Treat yourself. Oh no.
07x02,Ted (2030),"Since Mr. Cootes had mentioned the investigation, Marshall ran through internet. The majority of what he found was touching, seeing truly extraordinary, until..."
07x02,Marshall,Poor. This is very bad.
07x02,Girl,"Thank you, Stacy. Wesleyan has a cafeteria. Thank you to the generous donation of... Marshall arrives on camera, naked."
07x02,Marshall,Oh! Oh! Someone there mentioned generous donation? I'm Marshall Eriksen. But you can call me Biercules!
07x02,Lily,"Well, it could be anyone. And thin, I had forgotten this story Biercules.Who made this site first?"
07x02,Marshall,Pete Durkenson.
07x02,Ted,Of course.
07x02,Robin,This is the guy who convinced you to run around campus naked?
07x02,Marshall,"I wanted to join a club that I left three days later, because the clubs are stupid and elitist. And I also discovered that it was not a club."
07x02,Ted,"Oh my God. This is huge! I am invited to the Ball of Architects, the annual gala honoring the greatest architects of the city. Oh no. You guys see the problem?"
07x02,Robin,This is an annual gala that honors the greatest architects of the city?
07x02,Ted,"Robin, this is the biggest celebrity event of the year. In taking a girl at the ball, man, you reached third base. Whatever the girl I invite, it will be the steady girlfriend of Ted Mosby by the end of the evening. Ok, we stop to sit between two chairs. Robin, bring me my notebook. It's time to make lists of pros and cons."
07x02,Ted (2030),And the children they loved.
07x02,Nora,Let me clarify something for you. I do not date guys who lie to me.
07x02,Barney,"Okay, I did not know. Mea culpa. So, from now, more lies. I never lie to you. I'm serious. Ask me anything."
07x02,Nora,OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?
07x02,Barney,Have I ever... If I'm totally honest... Yes.
07x02,Nora,More than once?
07x02,Barney,"More than once... Wow, this is... I guess if we... so, technically, there were a number of times I've lied to a woman to sleep with her."
07x02,Nora,They were worth what?
07x02,Barney,"Nine or ten for most. There has been a 4 once. It was an easy girl.But, Nora, after that, I had to flee so fast. Honesty is good."
07x02,Nora,What was the lie?
07x02,Barney,You want me to tell all the lies I have told to put a woman in my bed?
07x02,Nora,A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.
07x02,Barney,You are good.
07x02,Unknown,Marshall goes to meet Pete.
07x02,Marshall,"Pete, Pete. Hey!"
07x02,Pete,"Biercules! Come here, man."
07x02,Marshall,"Hey, I tried to call you all night."
07x02,Pete,"My God, sorry. I should have responded but it was Thursday night."
07x02,Marshall,It is Sunday.
07x02,Pete,"And you know what that means. ""Edward bottles with money""!"
07x02,Ted (2030),"Children, Edward bottles for money is a game that involves taping two bottles of liquor at the base of the hands. The goal is to finish the two bottles. Oh my God, why am I telling you this? Good move."
07x02,Marshall,"Ok, you know this old video of me?"
07x02,Pete,I watch it every day.
07x02,Marshall,You have to take away the internet. Genre immediately.
07x02,Pete,"There are two ways for me to do it: Either you give me $ 4 million, or help me to go to the bathroom because I can not..."
07x02,Marshall,"Yes, both are non-negotiable refusal."
07x02,Pete,"So, I'm sorry we could not handle together. But if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of the game ""to Edward bottles of money,"" and the competition is raised."
07x02,Marshall,Who are you playing anyway?
07x02,Pete,Just myself.
07x02,Ted (2030),"Meanwhile, Barney continued to list every lie he used to sleep."
07x02,Barney,"I do not have time to explain how I got there. I just need someone to suck the poison. The surgeon gave me a new face, darling. You realize that I am alive? My name is David Beckham. If I castais only the white swan, is the role for you. No, I am a lesbian. What I wear is just very realistic."
07x02,Nora,"Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?"
07x02,Barney,"Oh, once I am the soul man. There was this pretty girl who only go out with black."
07x02,Woman,"Barney! Oh no, I knew it."
07x02,Unknown,"Ted, Lily and Robin are in the apartment."
07x02,Ted,I can not choose. They are both extraordinary.
07x02,Robin,"If architects had only two b*ll*ts, eh Ted?"
07x02,Lily,"I knew it. Ted, left or right?"
07x02,Ted,"Yes, yes, good idea. Let fate decide? I will choose the left."
07x02,"Lily, slapping him",Just called one of the two.
07x02,Robin,"Ted, to your heart, you know that you love one more than the other.Believe me, takes the other."
07x02,Ted,"Uh, I have perhaps not been clear is the... Robin Ball Architects.This event is a very hip."
07x02,Robin,"Ok, name one celebrity who will be there."
07x02,Ted,Lenny Kravitz.
07x02,Robin,Lenny Kravitz will be there?
07x02,Ted,Yes. He is there every year. And it's a rock star.
07x02,Robin,"You know, Ted, in hindsight, it is too early to choose between these two girls. Takes a friend. Like, I dunno, maybe a friend who has a poster of Lenny Kravitz on his wall, and may or may not have dated this post and transported from his high school..."
07x02,Ted,This list of pros and cons leads to nothing. I need a color scale.
07x02,Lily and Robin,Scale of colors!
07x02,Ted (2030),"And the children, we really sang."
07x02,Marshall,"Pete, please. I am unemployed. I have a huge mortgage. A baby arriving. And I'm about to lose a job that I really need because of a drunken video of 15 years ago."
07x02,Pete,"Ugh, you mean? Biercules, what's going on? Looks like you're another person. The guy in this video was cool. It had potential. It could have been president of a club one day."
07x02,Marshall,There is no club.
07x02,Pete,There he is just a troublemaker.
07x02,Marshall,"It's not that I want to be a troublemaker. Fair, I must be one. I'll be a dad. You have children one day, you will understand."
07x02,Pete,"Dude, I have 4 children."
07x02,Marshall,"Pete, please, remove the video."
07x02,Pete,"Ok, Biercules, I will remove it. If... you can beat me to the game of my choice."
07x02,Marshall,Oh no.
07x02,Pete,"And I choose the beautiful game, the sweet science..."
07x02,Marshall,"Pete, please, I'm tired..."
07x02,Pete,The sport of kings...
07x02,Marshall,I do not want to play Edward bottles money.
07x02,Pete,"I was going to the darts, but it's Edward bottles to money!"
07x02,Barney,"And that made all the lies related to space. Let the world of sports. Oh wait, I forgot for a space: ""I was bitten by a snake space. You have to suck all the poison around my... """
07x02,Nora,"Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that."
07x02,Barney,"So that was cool. I can remember, or...?"
07x02,Nora,"Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath."
07x02,Barney,"Well, I count three for and one against."
07x02,Nora,How can you still believe you have a chance with me?
07x02,Barney,"Because you are sat here all night. You could leave, but you did not. Listen, Nora, these lies, it was the old me. But I swear I try to change.You... make me want to change."
07x02,Nora,How I know this is not a lie?
07x02,Barney,I will prove it. I'll show you how much I'm serious. I will not leave this restaurant as I have not got a second date with you.
07x02,Nora,Goodbye Barney.
07x02,Barney,I do not laugh. It is a restaurant 24h/24. I will stay forever if necessary. And I will. Just water for me please.
07x02,Unknown,Ted shows the color scale to Lily and Robin.
07x02,Ted,"Ok, so the red bar indicates the level of attractiveness, blue, intellectual stimulation, green, emotional connection, yellow, compatibility aspirations of life, and purple, so she tried to pay or not."
07x02,Lily,"Well, it looks like Jessica wins in the first four categories."
07x02,Ted,Do not fight in...
07x02,Unknown,Robin leaves his room in evening dress.
07x02,Robin,"Oh, that? It's nothing. It cost me three months' rent, and uh, I have never worn because I bought it for a big party to which you would have asked what did not happen. But, you know what? Do not feel guilty."
07x02,Ted,What big event?
07x02,Robin,This thing with your uncle.
07x02,Ted,"His funeral? It fell into the water, he emerged miraculously from his coma."
07x02,Robin,And I forgive you. Now I can have my place and meet Lenny Kravitz?
07x02,Unknown,"Marshall returned to the apartment, drunk."
07x02,Marshall,I've done it again!
07x02,Lily,"Oh, dear. You're still drunk. I can not believe that I made the bet."
07x02,Marshall,"Just to be clear, ""I've done it again!""... Am not referring to my current state of inebriation."
07x02,Lily,What does it therefore reference?
07x02,Unknown,"Video shows Marshall, nude with two bottles taped hands."
07x02,Marshall,"My name is Marshall Eriksen. I'm 33 and if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes, look at this... Prostrate to Biercules!"
07x02,Lily,Well... it could be anyone...
07x02,Unknown,The phone rings but Pete it in the hands taped to the bottles.
07x02,Pete,"Oh, God..."
07x02,Unknown,Lily is on the phone.
07x02,Lily,"Pete, it's Lily Aldrin. I'll be brief. You're going out this video of Marshall. You know why? Because I am friends with three girls with whom you came to school, and girls say it all together. Every small detail.Huh. So... tick, tick... Pete so goes the clock in the little d*ck."
07x02,Ted,Pete has a small d*ck?
07x02,Lily,"I have no idea. Well, what do you take?"
07x02,Marshall,"It had to happen eventually. I tried so hard to suppress my... ""side-idiot-who-is-not-care-for nothing"" he rebelled and has struggled!"
07x02,Robin,It's for sure!
07x02,Marshall's voice,Look at me! I am a windmill!
07x02,Marshall,"Who do I crazy? I'm not ready to be a father. I thought I was, but it's like... My father never did such things, you know?"
07x02,Lily,"But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, ""Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head! """
07x02,Unknown,Barney rises behind Marshall and Lily.
07x02,Barney,Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!
07x02,Robin,"Barney, what are you doing here?"
07x02,Barney,"Oh, I told Nora that I would not leave until I have no second appointment, and I intend to do. I am here since 9 o'clock. I still need another minute. Say I'm crazy, but I'll stay here as long as it will not be returned."
07x02,Ted,"That's what I want. Barney's feelings for Nora, I want to feel again. I do not want to choose between two girls. I want to be completely baba one of the two."
07x02,Lily,"Yes, the stupid thing that makes us turn the head, pretty cool."
07x02,Marshall,"It's not bad. Also, for posterity, a statement drunk guy! I would not drink again."
07x02,Ted (2030),And of course...
07x02,Unknown,Flashback
07x02,Unknown,Barney and Marshall are at the casino.
07x02,Marshall,Carpet Biercules! Yeah!
07x02,Ted (2030),"But again, I digress."
07x02,Unknown,End flashback
07x02,Unknown,The next day the phone rings Marshall.
07x02,Marshall,Hello?
07x02,Garrison,Marshall! Garrison Cootes.
07x02,Marshall,"Yes, Mr Cootes. How are you?"
07x02,Garrison,"I wanted you to know we had conducted our inquiries, and there is something annoying."
07x02,Marshall,"Sir, the fact is that..."
07x02,Garrison,"The rainbow in this sample is definitely related to chemical plants. Ok, I... Skip a line... We love you! It takes you."
07x02,Marshall,"It's fantastic. Thank you, Mr Cootes."
07x02,Garrison,"Well, nothing. Oh, and when you're in the office, try to wear something Biercules. Ok? Wow, that was a big snake."
07x02,Marshall,"Oh, there was a snake in the swamp?"
07x02,Garrison,"No, I was talking about your penis. See you tomorrow."
07x02,Marshall,I got the job.
07x02,Lily,Yes!
07x02,Marshall,And I think my boss is already sexually harassing me. But he saw the video and he does not care!
07x02,Lily,Saw what? Maybe the video is not so bad after all.
07x02,Unknown,Marshall's phone rings again.
07x02,Marshall,Yes. Hello?
07x02,Pete,"Hey Marshall, I'm Pete Durkenson. We all went to Wesleyan."
07x02,Marshall,"Yes, no, I know. Pete, we drank together yesterday."
07x02,Pete,"Absolutely, now, the message from Lily makes sense. Listen, do not worry Bro ', I remove the video."
07x02,Marshall,You know what? Let her.
07x02,Pete,"As you wish, Biercules. (He hangs up and is in an operating room with a man on the table) Scalpel."
07x02,Marshall,You know what? That's good. I want my children to see every part of me.
07x02,Lily,Yes. Even the side where you route the East Village naked.
07x02,Marshall,I will remember Pete.
07x02,Lily,It's a good idea.
07x02,Ted (2030),"That night, I brought Robin Bal."
07x02,Robin,Thanks for taking me.
07x02,Ted,"The pleasure is mine. And you know, you might find it interesting.Some of these guys represent the history of New York."
07x02,Robin,"Yes, yes. Where is Lenny Kravitz?"
07x02,Ted,"Right there. Leonard Kravitz, world-renowned architect. This guy is a star. He will make his famous reading of 90 minutes on the beams."
07x02,Robin,"Well, great. I'll go find one myself and hang myself."
07x02,Ted,Ok
07x02,Ted (2030),"Children, you can not control when falling in love. It does not take days to think about. When this happens, you know quickly and with absolute certainty. I had forgotten. But reminded myself it was going."
07x02,Unknown,END
07x03,Marshall,"Oh my God, guys, I still have a hangover. Did I really ruin a marriage?"
07x03,Ted,"No, you did not ruin a marriage. Only reception."
07x03,Robin,And Miztva Bar next door.
07x03,Lily,And my dress. And your dress. You put a dress at one point.
07x03,Marshall,"Ok, you know what, it's good. I'll be a father, and I want to be the kind of man that my child can watch. Therefore, new resolution... I will never drunk! I'm serious!"
07x03,Ted (2030),"Children, this is not your Uncle Marshall was a problem with the drink. But every time he was a good resolution, we knew about that..."
07x03,Unknown,Flashback
07x03,Unknown,"The day before, Marshall returned to the apartment, drunk."
07x03,Marshall,I've done it again!
07x03,Ted (2030),But I lost a bit in the story.
07x03,Unknown,End flashback
07x03,Unknown,Barney joined the others on crutches.
07x03,Lily,What happened to your leg?
07x03,Barney,"Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some ""sympathy points"". She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of ""Man of La Mancha."" What do you think?"
07x03,Ted,Lose the cast.
07x03,Barney,A one-man show... I love it!
07x03,Lily,Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?
07x03,Barney,"You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it."
07x03,Ted,"Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls."
07x03,Unknown,Flashback
07x03,Unknown,Ted is at the newsstand and a woman reads the magazine in which it appears.
07x03,Woman,Is this you?
07x03,Ted,"Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted."
07x03,Woman,Hi.
07x03,Unknown,End flashback
07x03,Lily,"That's great, Ted."
07x03,Ted,It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.
07x03,Unknown,Flashback
07x03,Unknown,Ted behind her magazine down and when a woman arrives.
07x03,Ted,"Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby. (With another woman) I plead guilty. Salvation. Ted Mosby. (And another) It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of ""An egg on my face"" magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby."
07x03,Unknown,End flashback
07x03,Ted,"completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both."
07x03,Unknown,Marshall's phone rings.
07x03,Marshall,"Guys, this is Garrison Cootes."
07x03,Ted (2030),"Children, Garrison Cootes was a major partner of Honeywell & Cootes. One of the largest environmental law firms in the United States.Marshall would have given anything to work there."
07x03,Marshall,"If I did not work, I could finish... in kind, a Taco Belle somewhere. And nobody wants that. Unless you want to do this, like this you would have free tacos, since you are my friends. But now I need you all calmiez! (He finally won) Hello."
07x03,Garrison,"Marshall, it's Garrison Cootes. Sorry for not having reminded you earlier but I was stuck. What's funny, because I'm literally stuck in a swamp. Well, anyway, here I am trying to collect some samples for this trial on the pollution that we are working."
07x03,Marshall,I love the work you do.
07x03,Garrison,It's a...
07x03,Marshall,"No, I mean it."
07x03,Garrison,"No, no, there is a crocodile a few meters from me. So I'll just ignore the warm urine running down my leg right now, and tell you that we are very interested in your case."
07x03,Marshall,He's interested!
07x03,Garrison,"Obviously, we need to do some sort of verification purpose, you see, an investigation of crime and a Google search, but if nothing seems wrong to us, it takes you."
07x03,Marshall,"It's fantastic, Mr Cootes!"
07x03,Garrison,"Well, I'm going. It's very funny because in fact I really have run away."
07x03,Marshall,The crocodile you saw?
07x03,Garrison,"He is coming, yes."
07x03,Unknown,GENERIC
07x03,Ted (2030),"The next night, Barney and Nora saw each other for a coffee.Fortunately, without the neck brace ridiculous."
07x03,Barney,"Hi Nora, thank you for coming."
07x03,Nora,What happened to your neck?
07x03,Barney,"My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene..."
07x03,Nora,"Wow, this one has a beautiful chest."
07x03,"Barney, turning","What? Where? Oh, and shit."
07x03,Nora,Breasts...
07x03,Barney,"Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry."
07x03,Nora,What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?
07x03,Barney,"Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them."
07x03,Unknown,Ted returned to his apartment.
07x03,Ted,"I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait... (2 minutes later...) I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is t*rture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round."
07x03,Lily,Wait a minute. You're going to handle two girls at once? You do not think you should pick one before it gets too serious?
07x03,Ted,"Define ""serious""."
07x03,Lily,"Well, it's complicated. I think it would be when you have expectations, emotional involvement..."
07x03,Marshall,"Third base. Seriously, third base."
07x03,Ted,So I can go to the second two with no problem?
07x03,Marshall,Treat yourself my friend. Treat yourself. Oh no.
07x03,Ted (2030),"Since Mr. Cootes had mentioned the investigation, Marshall ran through internet. The majority of what he found was touching, seeing truly extraordinary, until..."
07x03,Marshall,Poor. This is very bad.
07x03,Girl,"Thank you, Stacy. Wesleyan has a cafeteria. Thank you to the generous donation of... Marshall arrives on camera, naked."
07x03,Marshall,Oh! Oh! Someone there mentioned generous donation? I'm Marshall Eriksen. But you can call me Biercules!
07x03,Lily,"Well, it could be anyone. And thin, I had forgotten this story Biercules.Who made this site first?"
07x03,Marshall,Pete Durkenson.
07x03,Ted,Of course.
07x03,Robin,This is the guy who convinced you to run around campus naked?
07x03,Marshall,"I wanted to join a club that I left three days later, because the clubs are stupid and elitist. And I also discovered that it was not a club."
07x03,Ted,"Oh my God. This is huge! I am invited to the Ball of Architects, the annual gala honoring the greatest architects of the city. Oh no. You guys see the problem?"
07x03,Robin,This is an annual gala that honors the greatest architects of the city?
07x03,Ted,"Robin, this is the biggest celebrity event of the year. In taking a girl at the ball, man, you reached third base. Whatever the girl I invite, it will be the steady girlfriend of Ted Mosby by the end of the evening. Ok, we stop to sit between two chairs. Robin, bring me my notebook. It's time to make lists of pros and cons."
07x03,Ted (2030),And the children they loved.
07x03,Nora,Let me clarify something for you. I do not date guys who lie to me.
07x03,Barney,"Okay, I did not know. Mea culpa. So, from now, more lies. I never lie to you. I'm serious. Ask me anything."
07x03,Nora,OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?
07x03,Barney,Have I ever... If I'm totally honest... Yes.
07x03,Nora,More than once?
07x03,Barney,"More than once... Wow, this is... I guess if we... so, technically, there were a number of times I've lied to a woman to sleep with her."
07x03,Nora,They were worth what?
07x03,Barney,"Nine or ten for most. There has been a 4 once. It was an easy girl.But, Nora, after that, I had to flee so fast. Honesty is good."
07x03,Nora,What was the lie?
07x03,Barney,You want me to tell all the lies I have told to put a woman in my bed?
07x03,Nora,A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.
07x03,Barney,You are good.
07x03,Unknown,Marshall goes to meet Pete.
07x03,Marshall,"Pete, Pete. Hey!"
07x03,Pete,"Biercules! Come here, man."
07x03,Marshall,"Hey, I tried to call you all night."
07x03,Pete,"My God, sorry. I should have responded but it was Thursday night."
07x03,Marshall,It is Sunday.
07x03,Pete,"And you know what that means. ""Edward bottles with money""!"
07x03,Ted (2030),"Children, Edward bottles for money is a game that involves taping two bottles of liquor at the base of the hands. The goal is to finish the two bottles. Oh my God, why am I telling you this? Good move."
07x03,Marshall,"Ok, you know this old video of me?"
07x03,Pete,I watch it every day.
07x03,Marshall,You have to take away the internet. Genre immediately.
07x03,Pete,"There are two ways for me to do it: Either you give me $ 4 million, or help me to go to the bathroom because I can not..."
07x03,Marshall,"Yes, both are non-negotiable refusal."
07x03,Pete,"So, I'm sorry we could not handle together. But if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of the game ""to Edward bottles of money,"" and the competition is raised."
07x03,Marshall,Who are you playing anyway?
07x03,Pete,Just myself.
07x03,Ted (2030),"Meanwhile, Barney continued to list every lie he used to sleep."
07x03,Barney,"I do not have time to explain how I got there. I just need someone to suck the poison. The surgeon gave me a new face, darling. You realize that I am alive? My name is David Beckham. If I castais only the white swan, is the role for you. No, I am a lesbian. What I wear is just very realistic."
07x03,Nora,"Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?"
07x03,Barney,"Oh, once I am the soul man. There was this pretty girl who only go out with black."
07x03,Woman,"Barney! Oh no, I knew it."
07x03,Unknown,"Ted, Lily and Robin are in the apartment."
07x03,Ted,I can not choose. They are both extraordinary.
07x03,Robin,"If architects had only two b*ll*ts, eh Ted?"
07x03,Lily,"I knew it. Ted, left or right?"
07x03,Ted,"Yes, yes, good idea. Let fate decide? I will choose the left."
07x03,"Lily, slapping him",Just called one of the two.
07x03,Robin,"Ted, to your heart, you know that you love one more than the other.Believe me, takes the other."
07x03,Ted,"Uh, I have perhaps not been clear is the... Robin Ball Architects.This event is a very hip."
07x03,Robin,"Ok, name one celebrity who will be there."
07x03,Ted,Lenny Kravitz.
07x03,Robin,Lenny Kravitz will be there?
07x03,Ted,Yes. He is there every year. And it's a rock star.
07x03,Robin,"You know, Ted, in hindsight, it is too early to choose between these two girls. Takes a friend. Like, I dunno, maybe a friend who has a poster of Lenny Kravitz on his wall, and may or may not have dated this post and transported from his high school..."
07x03,Ted,This list of pros and cons leads to nothing. I need a color scale.
07x03,Lily and Robin,Scale of colors!
07x03,Ted (2030),"And the children, we really sang."
07x03,Marshall,"Pete, please. I am unemployed. I have a huge mortgage. A baby arriving. And I'm about to lose a job that I really need because of a drunken video of 15 years ago."
07x03,Pete,"Ugh, you mean? Biercules, what's going on? Looks like you're another person. The guy in this video was cool. It had potential. It could have been president of a club one day."
07x03,Marshall,There is no club.
07x03,Pete,There he is just a troublemaker.
07x03,Marshall,"It's not that I want to be a troublemaker. Fair, I must be one. I'll be a dad. You have children one day, you will understand."
07x03,Pete,"Dude, I have 4 children."
07x03,Marshall,"Pete, please, remove the video."
07x03,Pete,"Ok, Biercules, I will remove it. If... you can beat me to the game of my choice."
07x03,Marshall,Oh no.
07x03,Pete,"And I choose the beautiful game, the sweet science..."
07x03,Marshall,"Pete, please, I'm tired..."
07x03,Pete,The sport of kings...
07x03,Marshall,I do not want to play Edward bottles money.
07x03,Pete,"I was going to the darts, but it's Edward bottles to money!"
07x03,Barney,"And that made all the lies related to space. Let the world of sports. Oh wait, I forgot for a space: ""I was bitten by a snake space. You have to suck all the poison around my... """
07x03,Nora,"Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that."
07x03,Barney,"So that was cool. I can remember, or...?"
07x03,Nora,"Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath."
07x03,Barney,"Well, I count three for and one against."
07x03,Nora,How can you still believe you have a chance with me?
07x03,Barney,"Because you are sat here all night. You could leave, but you did not. Listen, Nora, these lies, it was the old me. But I swear I try to change.You... make me want to change."
07x03,Nora,How I know this is not a lie?
07x03,Barney,I will prove it. I'll show you how much I'm serious. I will not leave this restaurant as I have not got a second date with you.
07x03,Nora,Goodbye Barney.
07x03,Barney,I do not laugh. It is a restaurant 24h/24. I will stay forever if necessary. And I will. Just water for me please.
07x03,Unknown,Ted shows the color scale to Lily and Robin.
07x03,Ted,"Ok, so the red bar indicates the level of attractiveness, blue, intellectual stimulation, green, emotional connection, yellow, compatibility aspirations of life, and purple, so she tried to pay or not."
07x03,Lily,"Well, it looks like Jessica wins in the first four categories."
07x03,Ted,Do not fight in...
07x03,Unknown,Robin leaves his room in evening dress.
07x03,Robin,"Oh, that? It's nothing. It cost me three months' rent, and uh, I have never worn because I bought it for a big party to which you would have asked what did not happen. But, you know what? Do not feel guilty."
07x03,Ted,What big event?
07x03,Robin,This thing with your uncle.
07x03,Ted,"His funeral? It fell into the water, he emerged miraculously from his coma."
07x03,Robin,And I forgive you. Now I can have my place and meet Lenny Kravitz?
07x03,Unknown,"Marshall returned to the apartment, drunk."
07x03,Marshall,I've done it again!
07x03,Lily,"Oh, dear. You're still drunk. I can not believe that I made the bet."
07x03,Marshall,"Just to be clear, ""I've done it again!""... Am not referring to my current state of inebriation."
07x03,Lily,What does it therefore reference?
07x03,Unknown,"Video shows Marshall, nude with two bottles taped hands."
07x03,Marshall,"My name is Marshall Eriksen. I'm 33 and if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes, look at this... Prostrate to Biercules!"
07x03,Lily,Well... it could be anyone...
07x03,Unknown,The phone rings but Pete it in the hands taped to the bottles.
07x03,Pete,"Oh, God..."
07x03,Unknown,Lily is on the phone.
07x03,Lily,"Pete, it's Lily Aldrin. I'll be brief. You're going out this video of Marshall. You know why? Because I am friends with three girls with whom you came to school, and girls say it all together. Every small detail.Huh. So... tick, tick... Pete so goes the clock in the little d*ck."
07x03,Ted,Pete has a small d*ck?
07x03,Lily,"I have no idea. Well, what do you take?"
07x03,Marshall,"It had to happen eventually. I tried so hard to suppress my... ""side-idiot-who-is-not-care-for nothing"" he rebelled and has struggled!"
07x03,Robin,It's for sure!
07x03,Marshall's voice,Look at me! I am a windmill!
07x03,Marshall,"Who do I crazy? I'm not ready to be a father. I thought I was, but it's like... My father never did such things, you know?"
07x03,Lily,"But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, ""Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head! """
07x03,Unknown,Barney rises behind Marshall and Lily.
07x03,Barney,Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!
07x03,Robin,"Barney, what are you doing here?"
07x03,Barney,"Oh, I told Nora that I would not leave until I have no second appointment, and I intend to do. I am here since 9 o'clock. I still need another minute. Say I'm crazy, but I'll stay here as long as it will not be returned."
07x03,Ted,"That's what I want. Barney's feelings for Nora, I want to feel again. I do not want to choose between two girls. I want to be completely baba one of the two."
07x03,Lily,"Yes, the stupid thing that makes us turn the head, pretty cool."
07x03,Marshall,"It's not bad. Also, for posterity, a statement drunk guy! I would not drink again."
07x03,Ted (2030),And of course...
07x03,Unknown,Flashback
07x03,Unknown,Barney and Marshall are at the casino.
07x03,Marshall,Carpet Biercules! Yeah!
07x03,Ted (2030),"But again, I digress."
07x03,Unknown,End flashback
07x03,Unknown,The next day the phone rings Marshall.
07x03,Marshall,Hello?
07x03,Garrison,Marshall! Garrison Cootes.
07x03,Marshall,"Yes, Mr Cootes. How are you?"
07x03,Garrison,"I wanted you to know we had conducted our inquiries, and there is something annoying."
07x03,Marshall,"Sir, the fact is that..."
07x03,Garrison,"The rainbow in this sample is definitely related to chemical plants. Ok, I... Skip a line... We love you! It takes you."
07x03,Marshall,"It's fantastic. Thank you, Mr Cootes."
07x03,Garrison,"Well, nothing. Oh, and when you're in the office, try to wear something Biercules. Ok? Wow, that was a big snake."
07x03,Marshall,"Oh, there was a snake in the swamp?"
07x03,Garrison,"No, I was talking about your penis. See you tomorrow."
07x03,Marshall,I got the job.
07x03,Lily,Yes!
07x03,Marshall,And I think my boss is already sexually harassing me. But he saw the video and he does not care!
07x03,Lily,Saw what? Maybe the video is not so bad after all.
07x03,Unknown,Marshall's phone rings again.
07x03,Marshall,Yes. Hello?
07x03,Pete,"Hey Marshall, I'm Pete Durkenson. We all went to Wesleyan."
07x03,Marshall,"Yes, no, I know. Pete, we drank together yesterday."
07x03,Pete,"Absolutely, now, the message from Lily makes sense. Listen, do not worry Bro ', I remove the video."
07x03,Marshall,You know what? Let her.
07x03,Pete,"As you wish, Biercules. (He hangs up and is in an operating room with a man on the table) Scalpel."
07x03,Marshall,You know what? That's good. I want my children to see every part of me.
07x03,Lily,Yes. Even the side where you route the East Village naked.
07x03,Marshall,I will remember Pete.
07x03,Lily,It's a good idea.
07x03,Ted (2030),"That night, I brought Robin Bal."
07x03,Robin,Thanks for taking me.
07x03,Ted,"The pleasure is mine. And you know, you might find it interesting.Some of these guys represent the history of New York."
07x03,Robin,"Yes, yes. Where is Lenny Kravitz?"
07x03,Ted,"Right there. Leonard Kravitz, world-renowned architect. This guy is a star. He will make his famous reading of 90 minutes on the beams."
07x03,Robin,"Well, great. I'll go find one myself and hang myself."
07x03,Ted,Ok
07x03,Ted (2030),"Children, you can not control when falling in love. It does not take days to think about. When this happens, you know quickly and with absolute certainty. I had forgotten. But reminded myself it was going."
07x03,Unknown,END
07x04,Unknown,I can't believe I'm talking to a therapist.
07x04,Unknown,"Well, usually, I'm not the touchy-feely, talk-about-your-emotions type, but with this, I just had to be a big enough person to admit that I need help."
07x04,Unknown,Huh. I guess this is what growing up feels like.
07x04,Unknown,This is court-mandated therapy.
07x04,Unknown,You assaulted a woman.
07x04,Unknown,Oh...
07x04,Unknown,That silly thing.
07x04,Unknown,I guess we can talk about that.
07x04,Unknown,It all began a few months ago.
07x04,Unknown,"There's this guy, Barney. We used to date."
07x04,Unknown,"I set him up with this girl I work with, Nora."
07x04,Unknown,Barney was working hard to prove he was real boyfriend material.
07x04,Unknown,"So, all week, I had to sit there watching him..."
07x04,Unknown,send flowers... chocolates... balloons. Then one day...
07x04,Unknown,Hey...
07x04,Unknown,I heard Barney didn't send anything today.
07x04,Unknown,Patrice said maybe he met somebody else.
07x04,Unknown,"She's such a b*tch, right?"

07x04,Unknown,"Nobody asked you, Patrice!"
07x04,Unknown,I'm sorry. You must already think that I'm a horrible person.
07x04,Unknown,"Robin, many of my patients are disturbed felons."
07x04,Unknown,"Last week, one of them mailed me a bag of his feces."
07x04,Unknown,"On the plus side, he remembered my birthday."
07x04,Unknown,You're doing fine.

07x04,Unknown,Not exactly.
07x04,Unknown,How I Met Your Mother 7x04
07x04,Unknown,The Stinson m*ssile Crisis
07x04,Unknown,"Original Air Date on October 3, 2011"
07x04,Unknown,"So, you're drunk under a desk, binge-eating stolen chocolates."
07x04,Unknown,"Boy, I am not coming across great here, am I?"
07x04,Unknown,This is not about how you're coming across.
07x04,Unknown,But no.
07x04,Unknown,"Okay, well, for this story to make sense, I have to tell you about my friends Marshall and Lily."
07x04,Unknown,The wine looks good.
07x04,Unknown,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, pregnant women can't drink alcohol."
07x04,Unknown,"No, my doctor says it's okay to have a sip of wine every now and then."
07x04,Unknown,Really?
07x04,Unknown,Dr. Sonya's great.
07x04,Unknown,"Whenever you ask her if you can have something, she's, like..."
07x04,Unknown,Just a little bit.
07x04,Unknown,"Wait, Dr. Sonya doesn't let you have sushi, does she?"
07x04,Unknown,Just a little bit.
07x04,Unknown,You're allowed to have Cheetos?
07x04,Unknown,Cheetos...
07x04,Unknown,"Ah, just a little bit."
07x04,Unknown,You mind if I double-check some of this stuff just in case?
07x04,Unknown,"I mean, it's the least I could do as part of Team Baby. ""Team Baby""? Whoa. What's next, like, cheesy matching T-shirts?"
07x04,Unknown,No.
07x04,Unknown,"Robin, I've had serial K*llers lead me to shallow graves faster than you're telling this story."
07x04,Unknown,"Okay! Look, it was getting impossible for me to be around Nora, so when an opportunity to get rid of her presented itself..."
07x04,Unknown,It's Sandy time!
07x04,Unknown,"Huddle up, g*ng."
07x04,Two things,1) Somebody stole a very expensive bottle of wine from my office...
07x04,Unknown,2) I need a producer to cover the G8 Summit in France.
07x04,Unknown,Nora will do it!
07x04,Unknown,"I mean, I know I have seniority, but..."
07x04,Unknown,I was gonna ask Nora anyway.
07x04,Unknown,"Thanks for the support, Robin. This is huge for me."
07x04,Unknown,"Are, are you sure about this, Sandy?"
07x04,Unknown,I
07x04,Unknown,do
07x04,Unknown,have seniority.
07x04,Unknown,"Oh, I'm sure. Nora's amazing."
07x04,Unknown,I want to have sex with her.
07x04,Unknown,"To deal with that rejection from Barney, not to mention your boss... must've really hurt."
07x04,Unknown,Why don't we dig into those emotions?
07x04,Unknown,So Marshall and Lily were at Dr. Sonya's office...
07x04,Unknown,It's fascinating how profoundly little I know about vaginas.
07x04,Unknown,Come in.
07x04,Unknown,"Ted, what are you doing here?!"
07x04,Unknown,"I checked up on all the stuff this ""doctor"" says is okay, and she's wrong."
07x04,Unknown,"So, for the health of this baby, I'm stepping in."
07x04,Unknown,Sounds like this Ted guy could benefit from some therapy.
07x04,Unknown,"Oh, he definitely could."
07x04,Unknown,This is unacceptable.
07x04,Unknown,"I'm sorry, we're gonna have to find a new doctor."
07x04,Unknown,"Guys, for the health of our baby, Our? we have to get serious about what Lily is putting in her body."
07x04,Unknown,"Speaking of which, when we deliver, we won't be using any dr*gs."
07x04,Unknown,Get out!
07x04,Unknown,Why are you kicking me out?!
07x04,Unknown,Because you're always intruding on our intimate moments!
07x04,Unknown,This is like college all over again!
07x04,Unknown,"Man, you guys sure are messy!"
07x04,Unknown,There's clothes everywhere.
07x04,Unknown,There's even a sock on the door!
07x04,Unknown,"A sock on the door is a universal code for ""We need some space."""
07x04,Unknown,"We needed it back then, and we need it now."
07x04,Unknown,Come on! We're a trio!
07x04,Unknown,We've always been a trio!
07x04,Unknown,We're right up there with Batman and Robin and Alfred.
07x04,Unknown,Out!
07x04,Unknown,Romeo and Juliet and the Apothecary.
07x04,Unknown,Now!
07x04,Unknown,Salt and Pepper and Cumin!
07x04,Unknown,What's that little guy up there do?
07x04,Unknown,"Oh, you poor girl."
07x04,Unknown,Robin!
07x04,Unknown,"It all ties together, I swear."
07x04,Unknown,"So, Nora was about to leave for France."
07x04,Unknown,"You know, not too long ago, I would have been worried that if I left you alone, you'd be up to no good with some blond bimbo."
07x04,Unknown,"Oh, I've changed."
07x04,Unknown,"I know, which is why when I get back, it's gonna be the start of a new chapter for us."
07x04,Unknown,A chapter of me and you and hopefully not that tie.
07x04,Unknown,You got me!
07x04,Unknown,Have a nice trip!
07x04,Unknown,"Dr. Stinson? I saw your ad, and I'm here for my free breast-reduction consultation."
07x04,Unknown,What do you think?
07x04,Unknown,Are they too big?
07x04,Unknown,I can't believe you're still running plays on dumb blondes!
07x04,Unknown,I thought you were serious about Nora!
07x04,Unknown,"No, I've been good, I swear!"
07x04,Unknown,I just forgot about my BDSes.
07x04,Unknown,BDSes?
07x04,Unknown,Bimbo Delivery Systems.
07x04,Unknown,"You see, over the years, I've launched a variety of elaborate systems that are always working to get me laid."
07x04,Unknown,Like my pop-up ads.
07x04,Unknown,"Oh, hi. I'm Dr. Barney Stinson."
07x04,Unknown,Are your really large breasts making everyday tasks difficult?
07x04,Unknown,Oh!
07x04,Unknown,There's just got to be a better way!
07x04,Unknown,There is!
07x04,Unknown,"I, Dr. Barney Stinson, for a limited time only, can give you a free breast-reduction consultation."
07x04,Unknown,Call me.
07x04,Unknown,"If your knockers are just too damn big, I can handle them... it."
07x04,Unknown,Women actually fell for that?
07x04,Unknown,Yeah. That business really took off.
07x04,Unknown,It played in all kinds of markets.
07x04,Unknown,"Okay, survivors, today's reward challenge is brought to you by Dr. Barney Stinson's Free Breast Reduction Consultations."
07x04,Unknown,"That scam was so successful, it spawned a related enterprise."
07x04,Unknown,"If you've been fooled by a well-endowed man who claimed to be a doctor offering free breast-reduction consultations, come see me, Arnie Linson, attorney-at-law, and join my class-action suit."
07x04,Unknown,"If your giant breasts have been wronged, I can handle them... it."
07x04,Unknown,I got 'em comin' and goin'!
07x04,Unknown,Uh-huh.
07x04,Unknown,I can't believe you go to so much trouble to get laid.
07x04,Unknown,"Yeah, sometimes I don't even have to shower."
07x04,Unknown,Mama loves it musky.
07x04,Unknown,I gotta shut down all these systems before Nora gets back.
07x04,Unknown,How am I gonna do all that in three days?
07x04,Unknown,I'll help you.
07x04,Maybe you should write on your little chart there,"""Patient selflessly tried to help a friend in need."""
07x04,Unknown,"First of all, this is a crossword puzzle."
07x04,Unknown,"Secondly, you were clearly planning on using those three days to steal Barney back."
07x04,Unknown,I am his friend! How dare you!
07x04,Unknown,"God, you think you're so smart just because you went to Harvard and then Princeton and then... wow, Harvard again."
07x04,Unknown,"Okay, yes, fine."
07x04,Unknown,I was... I was trying to steal him back.
07x04,Unknown,"This is good. You're finally opening up and talking about yourself, not just what Marshall and Lily were up to."
07x04,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, so Marshall and Lily were folding laundry..."
07x04,Unknown,That one's my fault.
07x04,Unknown,You know...
07x04,Unknown,Never mind.
07x04,Unknown,It's just...
07x04,Unknown,Forget it.
07x04,Unknown,"Marshall, you're a grown-ass man."
07x04,Unknown,"If you want to say something, just say it."
07x04,Unknown,"I feel bad for Ted! And if my mom were here, she would ask me what was wrong."
07x04,Unknown,You feel bad for Ted?!
07x04,Unknown,It's tough feeling like the third wheel.
07x04,Unknown,"Okay, first of all, I'm sure Ted's fine."
07x04,Unknown,Who eats salt and pepper without cumin?
07x04,Unknown,"Second, Ted is way off base coming after Dr. Sonya."
07x04,Unknown,We love her! Right?
07x04,Unknown,Don't tell me you're doubting Dr. Sonya!
07x04,Unknown,Just a little bit.
07x04,Unknown,What's that thing?
07x04,Unknown,"Well, for some women, it was the ashes of my parents."
07x04,Unknown,"For others, it was the trophy from Wimbledon."
07x04,Unknown,"And believe it or not, for one busty dullard, it was both."
07x04,Unknown,"Game, enormous set, match."
07x04,Unknown,Hello?
07x04,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, thanks for calling me back."
07x04,Unknown,"Uh, Barney, It's Mitch from the Port Authority."
07x04,Unknown,"Port Authority Mitch. You'd always call me whenever a wide-eyed farm girl would get off the bus with big dreams of Broadway and no idea what a ""casting director"" could legally ask her to do, hold or lick during an audition."
07x04,Unknown,"I'm sorry, old friend, your services are no longer needed."
07x04,Unknown,"Oh, God, I can't believe I'm doing this over the phone!"
07x04,Unknown,My love to Marge and the kids!
07x04,Unknown,I know. Here.
07x04,Unknown,"I didn't realize this would be so hard! I know, I know."
07x04,Unknown,"But hey, you know what? We're almost through our checklist."
07x04,Unknown,Okay? Okay?
07x04,Unknown,Okay.
07x04,Unknown,"Which reminds me, why am I calling a hair salon and saying, ""Jack Fantastic is quitting""?"
07x04,"Sweetheart, it's like Maya Angelou keeps telling Oprah, and I keep telling you","When you know better, you do better."
07x04,Unknown,"Wow, you are so wise."
07x04,Unknown,I wish you were straight so I could date you.
07x04,Unknown,"Well... as a matter of fact, I have an extremely attractive straight twin brother!"
07x04,Unknown,"Oh, hi."
07x04,Unknown,I cropped that Halloween photo.
07x04,Unknown,"It's just salt and pepper, now, so it looks ridiculous."
07x04,Unknown,"Ted, I want you back on Team Baby. What?"
07x04,Unknown,I knew you'd come around!
07x04,Unknown,Guys! I didn't really crop the photo!
07x04,Unknown,Plus...
07x04,Unknown,Good news.
07x04,Unknown,I signed us up for a birthing class.
07x04,Unknown,"Well, that's insane."
07x04,Unknown,"It's way too early for that, right, Marshall?"
07x04,Unknown,"Okay, listen. I am the father of this child, and I vote that we go to the birthing class."
07x04,Unknown,"Absolutely not. 'Kay, Lily."
07x04,Unknown,I hate to play this card... but if you don't come to this class...
07x04,Unknown,I'm withholding sex.
07x04,Unknown,I don't think she's coming.
07x04,Unknown,Yeah.
07x04,Unknown,I was a little suspicious when she had us take separate cabs.
07x04,Unknown,"Lily, don't do it!"
07x04,Unknown,Just a little bit.
07x04,Unknown,Think about our baby!
07x04,Unknown,"You got to be kidding me, Robin. Get to the as*ault."
07x04,Unknown,"Okay, fine."
07x04,Unknown,So Barney and I were finishing packing his apartment...
07x04,Unknown,Okay. One last item on the checklist.
07x04,Unknown,Disconnect the Cold Call 5000.
07x04,Unknown,What the hell's that?
07x04,Unknown,I was able to secure the customer database from a company that sells body glitter and high-end pasties.
07x04,"The Cold Call 5000 will dial every female client between the ages of 22 and 23, and leave the following message","Hi, I know this is crazy, but I saw you on the subway, and I knew we were meant to be."
07x04,Unknown,"If you believe in destiny, come to MacLaren's tonight and find me, Barney Stinson."
07x04,Unknown,Because I have this feeling that I'm supposed to be on you--
07x04,Unknown,with you.
07x04,Unknown,Why not re-record it?
07x04,Unknown,I did like a hundred takes. It kept happening.
07x04,Unknown,I can't believe Lily's not coming!
07x04,Unknown,You know what? Screw it!
07x04,Unknown,Who says that two bros can't rock a birthing class?
07x04,Unknown,Rock it!
07x04,Unknown,"Today, we'll be exploring ""The Sensual Massage."""
07x04,Unknown,Let's start by gently cupping our partner's hands... and just breathe each other in.
07x04,Unknown,"Thanks, Robin."
07x04,Unknown,You're the only person I know who would help me do all that.
07x04,Unknown,You're a real bro.
07x04,Unknown,"Am I, though? 'Cause I'm really more of a woman."
07x04,Unknown,To my femininity.
07x04,Unknown,"Nah, you're more of a bro."
07x04,Unknown,You're a dude. You're a man.
07x04,Unknown,"Hey, you are flying solo one more night."
07x04,Unknown,"How about I put on a smokin' hot dress, you slap a vest over that crime scene of a tie and we paint the town?"
07x04,Unknown,"I mean, when was the last time we got rip-roaring drunk in clothing that highlights our genders?"
07x04,Unknown,"So, your plan was to be out on the town, dressed provocatively, drinking with another woman's man."
07x04,Unknown,"Robin, this is our first session, and I know this is just one clinical opinion, but... you a dawg!"
07x04,Unknown,Yeah...
07x04,Unknown,There was just one problem...
07x04,Unknown,Surprise!
07x04,Unknown,I got back early!
07x04,Unknown,Hey!
07x04,Unknown,"Let me guess,"
07x04,Unknown,you got drunk under your desk again?
07x04,Unknown,"No, Mr. Harvard. I handled things a little differently..."
07x04,Unknown,"So, I suppose now you want me to talk about how it felt watching Barney and Nora walk off together, right?"
07x04,Unknown,I'd rather just skip ahead to the as*ault.
07x04,Unknown,My next patient thinks he's God.
07x04,Unknown,"On the off chance that he's right, I really don't want to keep him waiting."
07x04,Unknown,"Well, right after they left, something crazy happened."
07x04,Unknown,"Excuse me, do you know where I can find Barney Stinson?"
07x04,Unknown,He saw me on the subway and left me a message to meet him here.
07x04,Unknown,Why not re-record it?
07x04,Unknown,I did like a hundred takes. It kept happening.
07x04,Unknown,"Hi, I know this is crazy, but I saw you on the subway..."
07x04,Unknown,He asked me if I believed in destiny. And I do.
07x04,Unknown,We are so meant to be.
07x04,Unknown,Where can I find him?
07x04,Unknown,So I was faced with a moral dilemma.
07x04,Unknown,"Unleash this nut bag on them or be a bigger person, and help my friend."
07x04,Unknown,"Barney's at Café L'Amour,"
07x04,Unknown,75th and Amsterdam.
07x04,Unknown,Awesome!
07x04,Unknown,"No, wait, wait, wait!"
07x04,Unknown,"Okay, this isn't right."
07x04,Unknown,"Let's pop that top button, show off your gals."
07x04,Unknown,"Ooh! Good luck, go get 'em!"
07x04,Unknown,Let your love come through your fingers.
07x04,Unknown,"Dude, the rule is no moaning and keep your eyes open at all times."
07x04,Unknown,Stop being weird.
07x04,Unknown,"And hey, when do I get to be the woman?"
07x04,Unknown,"Now remember, the most important thing in pregnancy is to keep Mom calm and happy."
07x04,Unknown,She knows best what she needs.
07x04,Unknown,Trust her.
07x04,Unknown,"Now, Papas, I want you to take Mom's hands in yours, look deep into her eyes, and repeat after me."
07x04,Unknown,I believe in you.
07x04,Unknown,I believe in you.
07x04,Unknown,I honor your body's wisdom.
07x04,Unknown,I honor your body's wisdom.
07x04,Unknown,Your womb is a temple.
07x04,Unknown,Your womb is a--
07x04,Unknown,"Okay, I get it!"
07x04,Unknown,I feel terrible we didn't listen to what Lily wanted!
07x04,Unknown,"I know, so do I."
07x04,Unknown,"The truth is, I thought I'd be married by now and going through all this stuff alongside you guys."
07x04,Unknown,"But even if I meet the girl of my dreams right this second, I'm still one night and nine months away from having a family of my own."
07x04,Unknown,And that's assuming the mother of my children is just a huge sl*t.
07x04,Unknown,"Don't lose hope, Ted."
07x04,Unknown,That sl*t is out there.
07x04,Unknown,"Thanks, buddy."
07x04,Unknown,We owe Lily an apology.
07x04,Unknown,Yeah.
07x04,Unknown,"Dads, this is the time that I'll answer every question you've ever had about vaginas."
07x04,Unknown,Damn it!
07x04,Unknown,Hey.
07x04,Unknown,"I'm so sorry, Lily."
07x04,Unknown,You have just a little bit.
07x04,Unknown,"I realize now that it's my job for the next seven months to keep you happy, and that's why..."
07x04,Unknown,I'm no longer withholding sex.
07x04,Unknown,My hero.
07x04,Unknown,"But I want to make sure that you feel comfortable with Dr. Sonya, too."
07x04,Unknown,"I do. And you know what, the fact that she's so calm and laid back, maybe that's not a bad thing."
07x04,Unknown,Maybe that's exactly what we're gonna want in that delivery room.
07x04,Unknown,"Lily, if you don't push, I will shove this baby up your throat and pull it out of your mouth!"
07x04,Unknown,Where the hell is Marshall?!
07x04,Unknown,"That's a crazy story, kids. I'll get to that."
07x04,Unknown,"Hey, Ted's out in the hall. He wants to apologize, too."
07x04,Unknown,Hey.
07x04,Unknown,What happened to your sock?
07x04,Unknown,"Long story. Bottom line, I realized that sometimes love means taking a step back."
07x04,Unknown,"Well, not always."
07x04,Unknown,"I mean, sometimes it's better to interfere and sabotage stuff, right?"
07x04,Unknown,"Well, I think if you care about somebody, you should want them to be happy, even if you wind up being left out."
07x04,Unknown,Wow.
07x04,Unknown,"The lesson you learned with Lily and Marshall is directly applicable to my situation, and is therefore a valid part of how I'll eventually tell this story."
07x04,Unknown,Really?
07x04,Unknown,That's how that went down?
07x04,Unknown,"Point is, it all tied together, right?"
07x04,Unknown,Not really at all.
07x04,Unknown,Can we just get to the as*ault?
07x04,Unknown,To us!
07x04,Unknown,"Barney, it's me!"
07x04,Unknown,"I love you, Barney!"
07x04,Unknown,"Mmm, scallops look good."
07x04,Unknown,"Oh, they are."
07x04,Unknown,"But the last time I was here they ran out, so, uh... knock... on... wood."
07x04,Unknown,"Well, I have my eye on the red velvet cake for dessert."
07x04,Unknown,Lovely. Splitsies?
07x04,Unknown,"Nah, I want it all to myself."
07x04,Unknown,Really?
07x04,Unknown,Arm wrestle for it?
07x04,Unknown,No!
07x04,Unknown,All right.
07x04,Unknown,I love this place.
07x04,Unknown,"Thank you, babe."
07x04,Unknown,You're welcome.
07x04,Unknown,Babe.
07x04,Unknown,Barney doesn't know a thing about any of this.
07x04,Unknown,But that's why I got court-mandated therapy.
07x04,Unknown,You must think I'm nuts.
07x04,Unknown,I think you're a really good friend.
07x04,Unknown,Really?
07x04,Unknown,Really.
07x04,Unknown,"As far as I'm concerned, there was no criminal intent to this as*ault."
07x04,Unknown,"Well, thanks, Doc!"
07x04,Unknown,"Well, look at us!"
07x04,Unknown,We got this wrapped up in one session.
07x04,Unknown,"Go us, right?"
07x04,Unknown,Now let's discuss how you keyed the judge's car.
07x04,Unknown,Okay. Um...
07x04,Here's how it happened,"Marshall and Lily were supposed to go to the zoo-- okay, it all ties together, I swear. Now..."
07x04,Unknown,♪
07x05,Unknown,Narrator
07x05,Unknown,"Kids, in October 2011, your Aunt Robin was in therapy. And against all logic, it was actually going well."
07x05,Unknown,But why?
07x05,Unknown,Why-why am I constantly looking for reasons not to be happy?
07x05,Unknown,Maybe because the idea of finally being happy... terrifies you.
07x05,Unknown,"Bro, you are k*lling it today."
07x05,Unknown,Pshh!
07x05,Unknown,We got something good here.
07x05,Unknown,We are totes gonna conquer my fear of abandonment!
07x05,Unknown,I can't see you anymore.
07x05,Unknown,"(laughs) Nice. ""Oh, no! You're abandoning me!"""
07x05,Unknown,"Oh, no. You're abandoning me?"
07x05,Unknown,I'm sorry. I'm moving to Alaska.
07x05,Unknown,Narrator
07x05,Unknown,And that might have been the end of it.
07x05,Unknown,But a week later...
07x05,Unknown,Kevin?!
07x05,Unknown,What are you doing here?
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, look, I lied to you about moving to Alaska."
07x05,Unknown,I-I had to stop seeing you.
07x05,Unknown,Why? 'Cause I think you're cute.
07x05,Unknown,"And ethically, I can't be your therapist if I'm attracted to you."
07x05,Unknown,"Oh, I get it. You dump me as a patient just so you can ask me out?"
07x05,Unknown,I'm not gonna ask you out.
07x05,Unknown,You're not?
07x05,Unknown,No. We met in therapy.
07x05,Unknown,It's inappropriate for me to date a patient.
07x05,Unknown,"Anyway, it was nice seeing you."
07x05,Unknown,"Hey, wait."
07x05,Unknown,"How do you define ""date""?"
07x05,Unknown,"Two people having a meal together, sitting across the table making googly eyes at each other..."
07x05,Unknown,"What about two people eating alone, sitting side by side, making googly eyes at the coffee maker?"
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, it's not a date."
07x05,Unknown,Exactly. Not a date.
07x05,Unknown,Narrator
07x05,,And
07x05,Unknown,"so Robin and Kevin had breakfast alone, side by side every day that week."
07x05,Unknown,Until finally...
07x05,Unknown,"Oh, hey!"
07x05,Unknown,Sorry. No cabs.
07x05,Unknown,Ran 40 blocks all the way here.
07x05,Unknown,"May have knocked an old lady into the street, don't know, I didn't look back."
07x05,Unknown,Let's just go on a real date.
07x05,Unknown,"Yeah, that might be a good idea."
07x05,Unknown,Finally!
07x05,Unknown,♪ How I Met Your Mother 7x05 ♪
07x05,Unknown,Field Trip
07x05,Unknown,"Original Air Date on October 10, 2011"
07x05,Unknown,♪
07x05,Unknown,"Oh, I can't wait to see that movie."
07x05,Unknown,Is it good?
07x05,Unknown,"Awesome. Wait, totally hypothetically, do you like movies with a shocking twist where all the main characters die at the end?"
07x05,Unknown,Yes.
07x05,Unknown,You will love this movie.
07x05,Unknown,"Hey, guys."
07x05,Unknown,"Hey, Marshall. What's up?"
07x05,Unknown,"Well, I'll tell you what's up."
07x05,Unknown,"You know how my boss, Garrison Cootes, is, like, the most famous environmental lawyer in the world?"
07x05,Unknown,All
07x05,,Yeah...
07x05,Unknown,"I mean, it's him or the other guy."
07x05,Unknown,Sir Anthony Howel?
07x05,Unknown,All
07x05,,Yeah...
07x05,Unknown,"Anyway, he's an important guy, okay?"
07x05,Unknown,"And so today at work, I was trying to show him that I'm tough."
07x05,Unknown,I've been thinking about this settlement offer we're about to get from Gruber Pharmaceuticals.
07x05,Unknown,"If it's anything less than $20 million, then I'm gonna grab those corporate Earth rapists by their..."
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, I'm just gonna say something."
07x05,Unknown,"I'm growing a child in my belly, a child that just developed ears."
07x05,Unknown,This is a very thin sweater.
07x05,Unknown,"So please, if you must tell your story... just make it cheerful."
07x05,Unknown,Cheerful.
07x05,Unknown,Okay...
07x05,Unknown,"Then I'm gonna grab those corporate... employees... by their sweaty, dangling... hands... and squeeze until those greedy sons of... parents... realize that I'm the baddest mother... nature lover around."
07x05,Unknown,It's like watching
07x05,Unknown,The Breakfast Club
07x05,Unknown,on TBS.
07x05,Unknown,So what did he say?
07x05,Unknown,"Marshall, bend down so I can put my arm around you."
07x05,Unknown,That's all the way down. That's good.
07x05,Unknown,"Gruber Pharmaceuticals is a company full of well-meaning people doing their jobs, just like you and me."
07x05,Unknown,"Guys, I'm afraid that Garrison Cootes has gone soft!"
07x05,Unknown,He's like a teddy bear!
07x05,Unknown,A teddy bear or an Ewok?
07x05,Unknown,"You know, cute and cuddly around the village, but once the battle starts..."
07x05,Unknown,He'll smash in your metal skull with giant swinging logs.
07x05,Unknown,Marshall!
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, he'll hug you until you agree to peaceably shut down the Death Star."
07x05,Unknown,Nora
07x05,,"Hi, sweetie."
07x05,Unknown,Hey.
07x05,Unknown,What are we all talking about?
07x05,Unknown,Ewoks.
07x05,Unknown,"Ugh, I hate the Ewoks."
07x05,Unknown,The only good thing about Ewoks in that movie?
07x05,Unknown,You got to see some of them die.
07x05,Unknown,"Well, I fancy a pint."
07x05,Unknown,Nora hates Ewoks.
07x05,Unknown,"Well, I have to break up with her."
07x05,Unknown,"Be gentle when you tell her, guys."
07x05,Unknown,I'll call you from Vegas. Tell me how it went. Okay.
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, Barney!"
07x05,Unknown,Sit down!
07x05,Unknown,Not liking Ewoks is no reason not to date somebody.
07x05,Unknown,"Yeah, I mean, who knows what the rules are, ya know?"
07x05,Unknown,"I mean, you're dating a girl who doesn't like Ewoks, I'm dating my former therapist."
07x05,Unknown,Oh!
07x05,Unknown,Eww!
07x05,Unknown,We are gentlemen of Harvard!
07x05,Unknown,It's not a big deal!
07x05,Unknown,"Robin, if you asked a hundred people, ""Who's the worst person you could possibly date?"" they'd all say, ""Your therapist."""
07x05,Unknown,"Except the ones saying ""Barney."""
07x05,Unknown,"Hey! Yeah, that tracks."
07x05,Unknown,"Well, I should get going."
07x05,Unknown,I got the big field trip tomorrow.
07x05,Unknown,Field trip?
07x05,Unknown,Yeah. I'm taking my Intro to Architecture class to the GNB Tower construction site.
07x05,Unknown,I'm trying to get them interested in architecture as a career.
07x05,Unknown,Why? Are we running out of buildings?
07x05,Unknown,Are we running out of boring people?
07x05,Unknown,"Guys, this is a big deal, okay?"
07x05,Unknown,If I can get just one kid interested in becoming an architect...
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, I'm just gonna stop you right there."
07x05,Unknown,"Ted, it's an Intro class."
07x05,Unknown,"Yeah, don't try to"
07x05,Unknown,Stand and Deliver
07x05,Unknown,an Intro class.
07x05,Unknown,Nobody takes an Intro class to get on any other path but the path to not being hungover anymore.
07x05,Unknown,I learned that in my Intro to something-ology class.
07x05,"Well that's fine for something-ology, but tomorrow at 9",00 a.m. sharp Intro to Architecture is going on a field trip!
07x05,Unknown,All 200 of 'em.
07x05,"Well, it's 9",45.
07x05,Unknown,I guess the other 170
07x05,Unknown,"of you got lost, so we'll just start."
07x05,Unknown,"Now, some might say you guys are just taking this class because it's easy or because you've confused architecture with archaeology and think we're gonna do some cool Indiana Jones stuff today."
07x05,Unknown,But I think that...
07x05,Unknown,"I think just maybe, we got some future architects in the house."
07x05,Show of hands,who's thinking about a career in architecture?
07x05,Unknown,"Well, today, all that's gonna change."
07x05,Unknown,Follow me.
07x05,Unknown,"Hey. Uh, sorry, nobody gets in here without a site pass."
07x05,Unknown,"It's okay, I'm Ted Mosby, the architect of this building."
07x05,Unknown,I don't care if you're the archaeologist of this building.
07x05,Unknown,Site's closed.
07x05,Unknown,Moving on!
07x05,Unknown,Narrator
07x05,Unknown,"That morning, Marshall's firm was getting the settlement offer from Gruber Pharmaceuticals, and Marshall couldn't wait to see the teddy"
07x05,Unknown,bear turn into an Ewok.
07x05,Unknown,"Gruber Pharmaceuticals dumped toxic waste into Frog Creek, a tributary of the Trout River that feeds into Clearwater Lake."
07x05,Unknown,All three of which now need new names.
07x05,Unknown,So it's time to win one for Mother Earth.
07x05,Unknown,"Let's take out the trash, shall we?!"
07x05,Unknown,Yes!
07x05,Unknown,"All right, everyone grab a bag."
07x05,Unknown,"Blue is recycling, green, compost."
07x05,Unknown,There we go.
07x05,Unknown,Sheila... we're ready to hear your offer.
07x05,Unknown,"$24,000?"
07x05,Unknown,"Yeah , that seems reasonable."
07x05,Unknown,Narrator
07x05,Unknown,"Kids, I"
07x05,Unknown,was wandering the city with 25 Intro to Architecture students when your Uncle Barney came to my rescue.
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, guys, seeing a building get built, not that exciting."
07x05,Unknown,What's really exciting is the financial side of...
07x05,Unknown,"Sit down, Ted, I got this."
07x05,Unknown,"Hey, Weird Beard, lights!"
07x05,Unknown,College... it's a confusing time.
07x05,Unknown,"Oh, no."
07x05,Unknown,Studies show that 83% of all college students desperately need... sex lessons!
07x05,Unknown,Lights!
07x05,Unknown,"Barney, these are"
07x05,Unknown,18-year-olds!
07x05,Unknown,"Ted, these are 18-year-olds!"
07x05,Unknown,You have a girlfriend.
07x05,Unknown,But she doesn't like Ewoks!
07x05,Unknown,So what?
07x05,Unknown,"So what?! Bieber, lights!"
07x05,Unknown,"In 1983, George Lucas introduced the world to the Ewoks, a race of creatures indigenous to the second moon of Endor."
07x05,Unknown,"Now, the Ewoks have a rich back-story that the movie didn't really go into."
07x05,Unknown,"Barney, why don't you just skip to the part about you and Nora?"
07x05,Unknown,(sighs) Fine.
07x05,Unknown,"Ah, yes."
07x05,Unknown,"Ultimately, Ewoks split"
07x05,Unknown,Star Wars
07x05,fandom into two camps,"those born before, and those born after May 25, 1973: the Ewok Line."
07x05,Unknown,"Anyone born on this side of the Ewok Line was at least ten years old when Jedi came out, and thus too old for something so cloying and cute."
07x05,Unknown,"Anyone born on this side loved the Ewoks because, why?"
07x05,Unknown,They reminded you of...
07x05,Unknown,Our teddies?
07x05,Unknown,They reminded you of your teddies.
07x05,Unknown,"Thank you, Gina."
07x05,Unknown,How do you know her name?
07x05,Unknown,"And so... by the immutable laws of the Ewok Line, my 29-year-old girlfriend who hates Ewoks must in fact be no younger than... 37."
07x05,Unknown,That's only a year younger than Will's mom.
07x05,Unknown,How do you know my mom? Class dismissed!
07x05,Unknown,I need to be alone.
07x05,Unknown,"All right, we're moving on."
07x05,Unknown,"Ooh, can I come?"
07x05,Unknown,(cell phone rings)
07x05,Unknown,"Hey, baby."
07x05,"Hey, I just want to remind you we have Dr. Sonya at 4",00.
07x05,Unknown,I'll be there. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm bummed.
07x05,We got our settlement offer today,"$24,000 from a billion-dollar company."
07x05,Unknown,Wow. I take it people aren't happy about that.
07x05,Unknown,We won! Champagne and cake for everybody!
07x05,Unknown,They're celebrating.
07x05,Unknown,"I mean, it's crazy."
07x05,Unknown,We have no right to be eating cake.
07x05,Unknown,There's cake?! I'm on my way!
07x05,Unknown,Narrator
07x05,Unknown,"Meanwhile, the worst field trip of all time was still trucking."
07x05,Unknown,"All right, this,"
07x05,Unknown,this
07x05,Unknown,"is exciting, okay?"
07x05,Unknown,This is the very room where I had the idea for the GNB Tower.
07x05,Unknown,"Now, Webster's defines ""inspiration"" as..."
07x05,Unknown,Hold on. It's still loading.
07x05,Unknown,"Uh, hey, roomie."
07x05,Unknown,"Robin! Hey, what are you doing here?"
07x05,Unknown,"Well, I"
07x05,Unknown,was
07x05,Unknown,about to get my swerve on.
07x05,Unknown,You were?
07x05,Unknown,So you're the therapist.
07x05,Unknown,"You know, it's one thing to pretend to be a shrink and bang your patients. That's normal."
07x05,Unknown,"But to do it for real? A little creepy, bro."
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, it's not creepy."
07x05,Unknown,Both
07x05,,Ehhhh... it's creepy.
07x05,"Class, show of hands",Who thinks it's creepy to date your therapist?
07x05,Unknown,Pollstered.
07x05,Unknown,Get out!
07x05,Unknown,All right. We're moving on!
07x05,Unknown,"So, class, to your left, you will see some excellent examples of what we'd call windows."
07x05,Unknown,So where are we going now?
07x05,Unknown,I have no idea.
07x05,Unknown,This is a disaster.
07x05,Unknown,Some of them are already starting to go home.
07x05,Unknown,Although we seem to have picked up a German family.
07x05,Unknown,Barney
07x05,,Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
07x05,Unknown,That thing with Robin and her creepy therapist gave me an idea.
07x05,Unknown,"Ted, we have here a way to solve every single debate we've ever had!"
07x05,"I mean, just look at the sample","guys, girls, blacks, Asians, a German family."
07x05,Unknown,You can't pay for that kind of focus group!
07x05,Unknown,Is macaroni salad really a salad?
07x05,Unknown,"Hands up if you say ""no."""
07x05,Unknown,Ha!
07x05,Unknown,Jacob or Edward?
07x05,Unknown,Who says Edward?
07x05,Unknown,"Ha, ha. See? I told you."
07x05,Unknown,It's Edward James Olmos.
07x05,Unknown,Would you rather have sex with a dead human being or a live an...? Dude.
07x05,Unknown,What? Find the line.
07x05,Unknown,Who thinks David Hasselhoff is awesome?
07x05,Unknown,Hmm. It's true.
07x05,Unknown,"Okay. I've got one. If you're dating a girl, and she lies about her age, who says break up with her?"
07x05,Unknown,"Yes, yes, but what if the person she's lying to is notoriously shallow about age?"
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, but what if early in our relationship, she made a really big deal about wanting to not lie to each other?"
07x05,Unknown,What if she's hot?
07x05,Unknown,Who wants five bucks?
07x05,Unknown,Pollstered!
07x05,Unknown,Let's do this.
07x05,Unknown,(giggling)
07x05,Unknown,(clears throat)
07x05,Unknown,(murmurs)
07x05,Unknown,Hmm? Yeah.
07x05,Unknown,(giggling)
07x05,Unknown,Mm...
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, this is creepy."
07x05,Unknown,It's Crispin Glover creepy.
07x05,Unknown,You were my patient.
07x05,Unknown,You shared intimate stuff.
07x05,Unknown,It would be like dating your gynecologist.
07x05,Unknown,You were vulnerable.
07x05,Unknown,That's not something we can move past.
07x05,Unknown,(sighs)
07x05,Unknown,Guess not.
07x05,Unknown,"So, dating your gyno, that's bad, too?"
07x05,Unknown,"Oh, Robin."
07x05,Unknown,Kidding!
07x05,Unknown,"Look, we've got another one!"
07x05,Unknown,(laughing)
07x05,Unknown,"Come on, have a bite."
07x05,Unknown,"No, it's a matter of principle."
07x05,Unknown,"I don't care how good it is, I'm not gonna have a third piece of cake!"
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, guys, you all had a lot of fun today, but now it's time... to have even more fun!"
07x05,Unknown,Another cake!
07x05,Unknown,Marshall
07x05,,Another cake?!
07x05,Unknown,What is the matter with you people?!
07x05,Unknown,That settlement today was a flaming pile of... puppies... that aren't on fire!
07x05,Unknown,"Look at what's happening to the environment, and we're here doing the limbo?"
07x05,Unknown,"I mean, we should be ashamed of ourselves!"
07x05,Unknown,"Sir, all I meant was..."
07x05,Unknown,"Ten years from right now, everyone outside in that bullpen will be dead."
07x05,Unknown,What?
07x05,Unknown,"I've seen the latest research, Marsh."
07x05,Unknown,You know how I'm always saying it's not too late to save the planet?
07x05,Unknown,It's too late to save the planet.
07x05,Unknown,There's nothing to do but sit back and await our inevitable doom.
07x05,Unknown,(noisemaker tooting)
07x05,Unknown,"Oh, my goodness, a piñata!"
07x05,Unknown,"Just give me one minute, Larry."
07x05,Unknown,Thank you.
07x05,Unknown,"Our grotesque, inevitable doom!"
07x05,Unknown,"Now, of course, you can't go around telling all the people that the good ship"
07x05,Unknown,Environmentalism
07x05,Unknown,has sailed off into the sunset.
07x05,Unknown,There would cause a panic.
07x05,Unknown,"So, instead, what we do is, we come to work, we put on a happy face, and we sue the big guys for just enough money for some cake before the unfiltered rays of the sun fry us like chalupas, and our lungs fill up with salt water, and we all die!"
07x05,Unknown,Mmm. This cake is delicious. Everything's fine.
07x05,Unknown,"Ugh, this day sucks."
07x05,Unknown,Kevin and I are kaputski.
07x05,Unknown,You think that's bad?
07x05,Unknown,The world is coming to an end.
07x05,Unknown,You think that's bad?
07x05,Unknown,My girlfriend is 37!
07x05,Unknown,And my field trip is not going as well as I'd hoped.
07x05,Unknown,Hmm.
07x05,Unknown,This day sucks.
07x05,Unknown,"Professor Mosby, is the field trip over?"
07x05,Unknown,We'd like to go home.
07x05,Unknown,"Yeah, it's over."
07x05,Unknown,Auf wiedersehen.
07x05,Unknown,"I just wanted to inspire them, you know, like my professors inspired me."
07x05,Unknown,"But here we are, at the end of the day..."
07x05,Unknown,"Hey, class, quick question."
07x05,Unknown,"Uh, is anyone here thinking of becoming an architect?"
07x05,Unknown,(clucks tongue)
07x05,Unknown,Really?
07x05,"Yeah, dude. I mean, all jobs suck, but it's 4",00
07x05,Unknown,"in the afternoon, and you're out at a bar with your friends, so the hours can't be that bad."
07x05,Unknown,"So... yeah, I don't know, I'd think about it."
07x05,(voice cracking),I got through to you. Oh!
07x05,Unknown,"I mean, that is, if becoming a deejay doesn't pan out."
07x05,Unknown,You are gonna be a great architect.
07x05,Unknown,Narrator
07x05,Unknown,He became a deejay.
07x05,Unknown,"Robin, what are you doing here?"
07x05,Unknown,I told you I can't be your therapist.
07x05,Unknown,I know.
07x05,Unknown,"Today, I am your therapist."
07x05,Unknown,What?
07x05,Unknown,"You said yourself, I'm always looking for reasons not to be happy."
07x05,Unknown,"Well, I'm trying to change that."
07x05,Unknown,"So, if the only reason we can't be together is because I was in a vulnerable place for the first two hours we knew each other then that is two hours of vulnerability you owe me."
07x05,Unknown,Sit down.
07x05,Unknown,Okay.
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, but I must warn you, as a professional, I'm immune to..."
07x05,Unknown,Tell me about your mother.
07x05,Unknown,Everything she says is a manipulation!
07x05,Unknown,When I was seven years old...
07x05,Unknown,Mr. Cootes.
07x05,Unknown,Hey.
07x05,Unknown,"Listen, I've been thinking a lot about what you said yesterday, about how we're all gonna die."
07x05,Unknown,"Oh, I'm not gonna die."
07x05,Unknown,I bought an old mine shaft in Colorado.
07x05,Unknown,"I've spent the last six months filling it with canned goods, as*ault r*fles and all five seasons of"
07x05,Unknown,Friday Night Lights.
07x05,Unknown,"Okay, first of all, you can skip season two."
07x05,Unknown,"Second of all, after our talk..."
07x05,Unknown,I came pretty close to giving up myself.
07x05,Unknown,But then I went to the doctor with my wife... and...
07x05,Unknown,(taps key)
07x05,Unknown,I saw this.
07x05,Unknown,Boy or girl?
07x05,Unknown,I don't know.
07x05,Unknown,But I know I sure as hell can't give up now.
07x05,Unknown,"So, if you're just looking for someone to hold the other end of the limbo stick, you got the wrong guy for the job, and you know why? 'Cause you're three feet taller than everyone in this office?"
07x05,Unknown,"No. Because if I am gonna work here, then first thing tomorrow morning, I'm walking down to Gruber Pharmaceuticals, and I'm rejecting their offer."
07x05,Unknown,Even if I have to do it myself.
07x05,Unknown,(door opens)
07x05,Unknown,"Listen, I want you to know... I know."
07x05,Unknown,Know what?
07x05,Unknown,Nora.
07x05,Unknown,Barney.
07x05,Unknown,Nora.
07x05,Unknown,Just say what you're gonna say!
07x05,Unknown,I know you're old!
07x05,Unknown,"And I've been struggling with it, but when I look at you..."
07x05,Unknown,"I don't care, because I really like you."
07x05,Unknown,"And because for 37, you are keeping it toit!"
07x05,Unknown,You think I'm 37?
07x05,Unknown,"Well, if you were really 29, then you would have been a little kid the first time you saw the Ewoks and you would have loved them."
07x05,Unknown,"Barney, I didn't see any of the"
07x05,Unknown,Star Wars
07x05,Unknown,movies until last year.
07x05,Unknown,You... you're 29!
07x05,Unknown,You still have one good year left.
07x05,Unknown,What?
07x05,Unknown,Nothing.
07x05,Unknown,Mm...
07x05,Unknown,"But Naveen's the neurosurgeon, so of course he gets all the attention!"
07x05,Unknown,"Oh, Naveen is so smart, he operates on people's brains!"
07x05,Unknown,"Well, guess what, Mom?!"
07x05,Unknown,I treat the human mind!
07x05,Unknown,Our time is up.
07x05,Unknown,(exhales)
07x05,Unknown,I don't think this is gonna work.
07x05,Unknown,"I scared you off, didn't I?"
07x05,Unknown,"No, I mean, I don't think I can be your therapist."
07x05,Unknown,You're really cute.
07x05,Unknown,Narrator
07x05,Unknown,"The next day, Marshall returned to Gruber Pharmaceuticals alone."
07x05,Unknown,"I mean, you admit that you polluted the lake."
07x05,Unknown,We got the evidence.
07x05,Unknown,We got the charts.
07x05,Unknown,The fish...
07x05,Unknown,"Fish, huh?"
07x05,Unknown,Fish are weird.
07x05,Unknown,You ever think about the names of fish?
07x05,Unknown,"I mean, come on."
07x05,Unknown,Carp.
07x05,Unknown,"Garrison, what a nice surprise."
07x05,Unknown,"Your star apprentice was just, uh... ""Floundering."""
07x05,Unknown,"Little, little fish humor for you guys."
07x05,Unknown,It was not going well.
07x05,Unknown,"I'm here to turn down the 24,000."
07x05,Unknown,"Well, I can maybe get you"
07x05,Unknown,"24,500."
07x05,Unknown,Not... good... enough.
07x05,Unknown,Where are we going?
07x05,Unknown,"To w*r, son."
07x05,Unknown,We're going to w*r.
07x05,Unknown,We're going to save the planet.
07x05,Unknown,Narrator
07x05,Unknown,"And kids, as we now know, they did."
07x05,Unknown,"Hey, you know what was on last night?"
07x05,Unknown,Stand and Deliver.
07x05,Unknown,Mm.
07x05,Unknown,So good.
07x05,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
07x05,Unknown,Whatever happened to Jacob James Olmos?
07x05,Unknown,Who?
07x05,Unknown,Jacob James Olmos. Whatever happened to that guy?
07x05,Unknown,He never existed.
07x05,Unknown,It's Edward James Olmos.
07x05,Unknown,You're Olmos correct.
07x05,Unknown,It's Jacob James Olmos.
07x05,Unknown,It's Edward James Olmos.
07x05,Unknown,Jacob James Olmos.
07x05,Unknown,Edward James Olmos.
07x05,Unknown,"You're joking, right...?"
07x05,Unknown,Are you serious...?
07x05,Unknown,Seriously.
07x05,Unknown,Jacob James Olmos.

07x06,Unknown,"By the fall of 2011, technology had taken a lot of the intrigue out of life."
07x06,Unknown,The Internet had everyone's wall of information.
07x06,Unknown,Nothing was a mystery anymore.
07x06,Unknown,"But, kids, there was a time before that, way back in the dark ages."
07x06,Unknown,Are you people insane?!
07x06,Unknown,The most popular food in America is the cheeseburger!
07x06,Unknown,No way! It's pizza!
07x06,Unknown,"Are we forgetting about a certain Mr. Furter, first name Frank?"
07x06,Unknown,"Um, what did every kid bring in their lunchbox every day till grade eight?"
07x06,Unknown,Pancakes with maple syrup.
07x06,Unknown,"Thanks, Canada."
07x06,Unknown,We're looking for a food the average
07x06,Unknown,American
07x06,Unknown,eats.
07x06,Unknown,Marshall
07x06,,Yeah. Yeah.
07x06,Unknown,Oh!
07x06,Unknown,Chinese food.
07x06,Unknown,And then came the smartphone.
07x06,Unknown,"Hey, remember when we were arguing about the most popular food?"
07x06,Unknown,It's bread.
07x06,Unknown,Others
07x06,,Hm.
07x06,Unknown,And the barroom debate was dead.
07x06,Unknown,Barney
07x06,Unknown,You guys are idiots!
07x06,Unknown,Narrator
07x06,Unknown,"Okay, not completely dead."
07x06,Unknown,You are seriously telling me you don't want to open that envelope and find out if you're having a boy or a girl?
07x06,Unknown,Nope. Dr. Sonya only gave us this in case we wanted to know.
07x06,Unknown,But we don't.
07x06,Unknown,Lilypad and I are just gonna wait till that baby pops out and enjoy the big surprise.
07x06,Unknown,"Look, I have pretended to be a licensed therapist enough times to know there is something unhealthy about your not wanting to find out."
07x06,Unknown,"Back me up here, Kev."
07x06,Unknown,"No, no, no, no, no."
07x06,Unknown,This real therapist won't risk upsetting his wonderful new girlfriend by analyzing her wonderful friends.
07x06,Unknown,No matter how mentally unbalanced they may be.
07x06,Unknown,I hear you.
07x06,Unknown,I don't think you do.
07x06,Unknown,We just don't want to burden our little angel with all kinds of
07x06,Unknown,gender-specific expectations.
07x06,Unknown,Boys can do ballet; girls can play football.
07x06,Unknown,"Hell, the Green Bay Packers have been proving that for years."
07x06,Unknown,That would've gotten a big laugh at a sports bar.
07x06,Unknown,"Well, I say define gender roles early."
07x06,Unknown,All the other girls got a pretty dress and a cake when they turned 14.
07x06,Unknown,Me...
07x06,Unknown,"I want to go home, Daddy!"
07x06,Unknown,That direction is nothing but wolves.
07x06,Unknown,And 40 kilometers that way is the mining town of Smithers.
07x06,Unknown,I'd take my chances with the wolves.
07x06,Unknown,I'll see you in three days.
07x06,Unknown,"Well, wait, wh-what am I supposed to eat?"
07x06,Unknown,"Hey, you've got a knife, the forest is full of animals--"
07x06,Unknown,"what do you want, a buffet?"
07x06,Unknown,Papa...!
07x06,Unknown,"Happy birthday, son...!"
07x06,Unknown,"Got any thoughts on that, Doc?"
07x06,Unknown,"If you guys think I'm going near that,"
07x06,Unknown,you're
07x06,Unknown,crazy.

07x06,Unknown,(gasps)
07x06,Unknown,"""Slow and overrated""?"
07x06,Unknown,Really?
07x06,Unknown,That's
07x06,Unknown,your takeaway?
07x06,Unknown,It's the Wood Man at the height of his powers.
07x06,Unknown,The way he broke the fourth wall by talking directly to camera?
07x06,Unknown,People have been ripping that off ever since.
07x06,Unknown,Can you believe this guy?
07x06,Unknown,Paula Vincenzo.
07x06,Unknown,She's in the bathroom.
07x06,Unknown,What's wrong with her?
07x06,Unknown,Total psycho. Her Facebook wall has a link to a site about dating inanimate objects.
07x06,"For most of last year, she was engaged... to a mini fridge. And there's pictures","her and the mini fridge on a hike, her and the mini fridge in wine country, here's the mini fridge meeting her parents..."
07x06,Unknown,Run like the wind.
07x06,Unknown,(footsteps approaching)
07x06,Unknown,So... want to go back to my place?
07x06,Unknown,"Yeah, all right."
07x06,Unknown,"Well, thanks to us, you ran screaming from that freak show, right?"
07x06,Unknown,Absolutely.
07x06,Unknown,Cuckoo!
07x06,Unknown,So what's the problem?
07x06,Unknown,You need us.
07x06,Unknown,"No, I don't, okay?"
07x06,Unknown,I don't want a background check.
07x06,Unknown,I want adventure and excitement.
07x06,Unknown,"Look, if it's a choice between mystery and history, I want mystery."
07x06,Unknown,In fact...
07x06,Unknown,"Ted, I wouldn't..."
07x06,Unknown,"Uh, Janet."
07x06,Unknown,"I have a theory. People don't get the chance to just discover each other anymore, so... here's my idea."
07x06,Unknown,"Before we go out tomorrow, let's not do any prior Internet research on each other."
07x06,Unknown,"It sounds like I'm hiding something horrible, doesn't it?"
07x06,Unknown,I'm pretty sure you're a serial k*ller.
07x06,Unknown,I'm not. I'm not.
07x06,Unknown,"It's just, you know, like, when my parents met, they didn't have the Internet--"
07x06,Unknown,they just went out on a blind date and fell in love.
07x06,Unknown,That's nice. And they're still together?
07x06,Unknown,Right up to the divorce.
07x06,Unknown,"The point is, I'd love to get to know you in person, not on my computer."
07x06,Unknown,I like that. What started out sounding really creepy turned out really sweet.
07x06,Unknown,That's kind of my move.
07x06,Unknown,(laughs)
07x06,Unknown,"And she was on board with the whole ""no Internet"" thing?"
07x06,Unknown,She loved it.
07x06,Unknown,The b*tch is hiding something.
07x06,Unknown,The b*tch is totally hiding something.
07x06,Unknown,"Hey, Ted, before you leave--"
07x06,Unknown,is Janet McIntyre M-A-C or M-C?
07x06,Unknown,"For the last time, I don't want to know anything about her before the date."
07x06,Unknown,"You might want to see this, Ted-- naked pictures."
07x06,Unknown,That's not Janet.
07x06,Unknown,"Who, now?"
07x06,Unknown,Seriously... if you guys respect me as a friend... stop looking.
07x06,Unknown,"Well, Ted was pretty clear there, so... let's shut those laptops and go help Lily and Marshall, just like we promised."
07x06,Unknown,Let's leave the laptops here and go paint that baby room.
07x06,Unknown,Without laptops.
07x06,Unknown,Or bring the laptops. Either way.
07x06,Unknown,This is exciting.
07x06,Unknown,I give you... the color our child will grow up with.
07x06,Unknown,"Yellow, like the sun."
07x06,Unknown,Or daughter. Pun snuggle.
07x06,Unknown,"Oh, God, this room's about to get its first spit-up."
07x06,Unknown,Just open the envelope already!
07x06,Unknown,"Kevin, will you please tell Barney that it is perfectly normal for us to want to preserve the mystery."
07x06,Unknown,I'm not here to analyze; I'm here to win boyfriend points.
07x06,Unknown,"By the way, you all look great, especially Robin."
07x06,Unknown,"Come on, if you don't know the gender, you're gonna get generic crap at the baby shower."
07x06,Unknown,"But if you do know the gender, you'll get, oh, I don't know, this!"
07x06,Unknown,Marshall! Lights!

07x06,Unknown,This is so great.
07x06,Unknown,"Right? See, if we'd researched each other, we'd both be secretly steering the conversation one way or the other."
07x06,Unknown,"But this is more exciting, right?"
07x06,Unknown,Way more exciting.
07x06,Unknown,"I mean, we can talk about anything we want."

07x06,Unknown,"So, are you folks gonna have dinner or just drinks?"

07x06,Unknown,Yeah.
07x06,Unknown,At least we don't do that.
07x06,Unknown,"And to top it off, all the meddling in Ted's love life, not to mention Lily's pregnancy?"
07x06,Unknown,It all strikes me as just deeply dysfunctional.

07x06,Unknown,First of all... this is Times New Roman.

07x06,Unknown,"Okay, let's do this."
07x06,Unknown,Let-Let's find out each other's likes and dislikes.
07x06,Unknown,Start with something totally random.

07x06,Unknown,Are you a fan of--
07x06,Unknown,I don't know--
07x06,Unknown,Annie Hall?
07x06,Unknown,"I'm guessing that's not random at all, and you use that movie to test whether a girl is cool?"
07x06,Unknown,"No, it's-it's the first movie that popped into..."
07x06,Unknown,I love
07x06,Unknown,Annie Hall.

07x06,Unknown,"Uh, well, I got to run to the restroom."
07x06,Unknown,"No internet, Mister."
07x06,Unknown,"If you find out my deep, dark secret, I'll have to k*ll you."
07x06,Unknown,It's just my friends checking up on me.
07x06,Unknown,I'll politely let them know we're having a lovely time.
07x06,Unknown,Okay.
07x06,Unknown,"Ted says, ""I'm not clicking on the link, so leave me alone."""
07x06,Unknown,"And then either texted me a bunch of symbols for profanity, or got food poisoning and dropped the weirdest deuce of all time."
07x06,Unknown,You guys have to see this.
07x06,Unknown,No. We're with Ted on this.
07x06,Unknown,"We don't want to find out about Janet, just like we don't want to find out about the baby."
07x06,Unknown,"Because we like mystery, whether it's the hairy majesty of Bigfoot, or the bloodsucking ferocity of the Chupacabra, or the gender of our little miracle."
07x06,Unknown,"Thanks for putting those together in the same sentence, sweetie."
07x06,Unknown,Mm.
07x06,Unknown,"Look, if you guys don't want to know, how about this?"
07x06,Unknown,"Let me look, and I won't tell you."
07x06,Unknown,Absolutely not. Fine.
07x06,Unknown,(gasping)
07x06,Unknown,"Baby, if it will shut him up, what's the harm?"
07x06,Unknown,Can I...?
07x06,Unknown,(muttering)
07x06,Unknown,(both giggling)
07x06,Unknown,This may have been a mistake.

07x06,Unknown,"...friend, your hair looks fantastic!"
07x06,Unknown,Twins! was the feel-good movie of 1988.
07x06,Unknown,"Okay, Barney, hey, it doesn't matter what you guys say."
07x06,Unknown,We're not gonna cave.
07x06,Unknown,"Yes, we are!"
07x06,Unknown,"Oh, just open your eyes."
07x06,Unknown,This gender-neutral yellow is horrible!
07x06,Unknown,We're clearly gonna paint over the whole thing!
07x06,Unknown,That's what you want to hear.
07x06,Unknown,I gots to know!
07x06,Unknown,"Yeah. ""It's a..."""
07x06,Unknown,It's a...
07x06,Unknown,Where is the rest of the card?
07x06,Unknown,I ripped it in half.
07x06,Unknown,"I knew you'd be desperate to see it, and I'll give it to you."
07x06,Unknown,All you have to do is admit that mystery is stupid by reading about Janet McIntyre.
07x06,Unknown,This is in no way emotional extortion.
07x06,Unknown,You guys are great.
07x06,Unknown,"Fine, we'll look at your laptop."
07x06,Unknown,Both
07x06,,Sweet... mother... of God.
07x06,Unknown,I can't really see the computer screen.
07x06,Unknown,It just went down the wrong pipe.

07x06,Unknown,Ted
07x06,Unknown,Whoa.
07x06,Unknown,"If Lily and Marshall want me to click on it, maybe Janet really does have a deep, dark secret."
07x06,Unknown,What's going on?
07x06,Unknown,I'm a prost*tute.
07x06,Unknown,"You didn't think I was actually into you, did you?"
07x06,Unknown,Sort of.
07x06,Unknown,(laughter)
07x06,Unknown,Ted
07x06,Unknown,"Get it together, Mosby."
07x06,Unknown,Oh.
07x06,Unknown,(sighs)
07x06,Unknown,"You don't buy beer, you rent it."
07x06,Unknown,Am I right?
07x06,Unknown,This is the men's room.
07x06,Unknown,I know.
07x06,Unknown,I'm a dude.
07x06,Unknown,(gasps)
07x06,Unknown,(sighs)
07x06,Unknown,"Listen, there's something you should know."
07x06,Unknown,I lied.
07x06,Unknown,I only kind of liked
07x06,Unknown,Annie Hall.
07x06,Unknown,(gasps)
07x06,Unknown,Ted
07x06,Unknown,I gots to know!
07x06,Unknown,Sweet... mother... of God.
07x06,Unknown,Hey.
07x06,Unknown,(sighs)
07x06,Unknown,"Ted, are you okay? You look freaked out."
07x06,Unknown,I'm not freaked out.
07x06,Unknown,Narrator
07x06,Unknown,I was freaked out. Why? 'Cause I had just discovered that Janet McIntyre was... amazing!
07x06,Unknown,"And just like that, the wall went up."
07x06,Unknown,"Okay, he looked at Janet McIntyre's Internet extravaganza."
07x06,Unknown,Here's the other half of the card.
07x06,Unknown,Wait. Should we do this? I...
07x06,Unknown,"I don't know. I mean, my soul says no, but these hideous yellow walls scream yes."
07x06,Unknown,"Should I just stop, or...?"
07x06,Unknown,Sweet mother of God!
07x06,Unknown,A dog in Ottawa ran all the way to Saskatoon!
07x06,Unknown,What?
07x06,Unknown,We figured out the Janet thing.
07x06,Unknown,I'm catching up on Canada.
07x06,Unknown,(gasps)
07x06,Unknown,"You're with me on this, right?"
07x06,Unknown,"Otherwise, I can go down, and I can get the card."
07x06,Unknown,Absolutely.
07x06,Unknown,"Oh, thank you."
07x06,Unknown,Narrator
07x06,Unknown,"And so the gender remained a secret, but Janet McIntyre's life no longer was."
07x06,Unknown,There was only one problem.
07x06,Unknown,"Ted, what's going on?"
07x06,Unknown,Nothing.
07x06,Unknown,Did I mention that I'm the youngest architect in New York history to have a skyscraper built?
07x06,Unknown,"Oh. So, I'm not quite as far beneath you as you might think."
07x06,Unknown,Why would I think that?
07x06,Unknown,"No reason, but this one time in sixth grade, I saw a raccoon trapped in a gutter, and I told my dad, and the firemen came and got it out, so it's not like I pulled a baby from a creek or anything, but at least I didn't ignore it and keep lighting bugs on fire with my magnifying glass."
07x06,Unknown,"We had one promise, and you broke it."
07x06,Unknown,What are you talking about?
07x06,Unknown,"You looked me up, and now you find me intimidating."
07x06,Unknown,"Why-Why would I find you intimidating, okay?"
07x06,Unknown,"It's not like I donated a kidney, but I donated blood once, although I wound up fainting, and they had to put it all back in."
07x06,Unknown,(sighs)
07x06,Unknown,I was so excited about this.
07x06,Unknown,But now you're just a blubbering idiot like the rest of them.
07x06,Unknown,"No, I ain't!"
07x06,Unknown,"I mean, no, I never do that thing you says."
07x06,Unknown,(sighs)
07x06,Unknown,"What I mean is, you gooder than me no make difference!"
07x06,Unknown,And that's that.
07x06,Unknown,I wish to God I'd never clicked on that link.
07x06,Unknown,"I'm sorry, Ted."
07x06,Unknown,We were just trying to help.
07x06,Unknown,"I said it was meddling and manipulative, but Kevin insisted we butt in."
07x06,Unknown,(ding)
07x06,Unknown,"No, it's my fault."
07x06,Unknown,I never should have looked.
07x06,Unknown,"In the battle of mystery versus history, it's best not to know."
07x06,Unknown,Lily Pad?
07x06,Unknown,What?

07x06,Unknown,I'll go buy some blue paint.

07x06,Unknown,"Phineas, take us up!"

07x07,Unknown,I'm gonna go to the loo.
07x07,Unknown,"I don't actually have to go, I just want a seat all to myself."
07x07,Unknown,"So, would anyone care to ask me where Nora and I are going tonight?"
07x07,Unknown,Don't ask him. It's a trap.
07x07,Unknown,Where you going?
07x07,Unknown,"Come on, man, for God's sake!"
07x07,Unknown,"Bootytown, Kevin!"
07x07,Unknown,We are finally going to Bootytown.
07x07,Unknown,And that's why we don't ask him.
07x07,Unknown,"I'm thinking I'm gonna hop on the Long Thighland Expressway, stop off for a nibble in Breastport, and then, with any luck, I'll be pulling into the Pork Authority by midnight."
07x07,Unknown,Wait. You're
07x07,Unknown,finally
07x07,Unknown,going to Bootytown?
07x07,Unknown,"Look, we just don't want to rush anything, okay?"
07x07,Unknown,So we decided to wait until she decides to let me have sex with her.
07x07,Unknown,And that's gonna be tonight!
07x07,Unknown,How do you know for sure?
07x07,Unknown,"Ah, something she said earlier."
07x07,Unknown,"Guess what, my sweet boy, I've got a special treat for you tonight."
07x07,Unknown,(electric guitar riff plays)
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, you're going to Bootytown."
07x07,Unknown,"Hello again, my darlings."
07x07,Unknown,"Barney, I hope you're ready for tonight."
07x07,Unknown,Because you're gonna have to use muscles you haven't used in years.
07x07,Unknown,I am?
07x07,Unknown,Yes.
07x07,Unknown,"And I hope you have some aspirin at home, because your arse is gonna be k*lling you tomorrow."
07x07,Unknown,It is?
07x07,Unknown,Indeed.
07x07,Unknown,Because tonight...
07x07,Unknown,The Pork Authority's closed.
07x07,Unknown,"Looks like it's Hand Central Station for you, little buddy."

07x07,Unknown,So that's your special treat?
07x07,Unknown,Ice skating?

07x07,Unknown,Ask me what I really think of her.
07x07,Unknown,What do you really think of her?
07x07,Unknown,"Guys, she's great, seriously."
07x07,Unknown,Just drop it.
07x07,Unknown,Ask me one more time.
07x07,Unknown,What do you really think?
07x07,Unknown,"Fine! If you really must know, I do not like Barney with that woman!"
07x07,Unknown,Happy?
07x07,Unknown,What could you possibly not like about Nora?
07x07,Unknown,Her hair? Her mousy little nose?
07x07,Unknown,The way she does everything perfectly?
07x07,Unknown,"I mean, what's not to like?"
07x07,Unknown,It's not that I don't like her. It's just...
07x07,Unknown,She's our mom.
07x07,Unknown,"What do you mean, she's your mom?"
07x07,Unknown,Everything about her is vaguely our mom-like.
07x07,Unknown,The British accent...
07x07,Unknown,"Hello again, my darlings."
07x07,Unknown,"Mom's obsessed with Julie Andrews, so when we were growing up..."
07x07,(British accent),"Hello again, my darlings."
07x07,Unknown,"Come here, you."
07x07,Unknown,Hey.
07x07,Unknown,And the way she hugs him.
07x07,Unknown,"Left hand on the nape of the neck, three gentle strokes on the back with the right?"
07x07,Unknown,"Come here, you."
07x07,Unknown,Trademark Loretta Stinson.
07x07,Unknown,But here's the clincher...
07x07,Unknown,"Guess what, my sweet boy."
07x07,Unknown,Guess what my sweet boy.
07x07,Unknown,I've got a special treat for you tonight.
07x07,Unknown,I've got a special treat for you tonight.
07x07,Unknown,Ice cream!
07x07,Unknown,(electric guitar riff plays)
07x07,Unknown,They're coming. Be cool.
07x07,Unknown,Forgot my raincoat.
07x07,Unknown,That makes one of us.
07x07,Unknown,"Well, shall we?"
07x07,Unknown,We shall.
07x07,Unknown,"Ooh, don't wear out that tongue, Barney."
07x07,Unknown,Don't wait up.
07x07,Unknown,"I mean, sure, Barney has slept with plenty of other people's mothers."
07x07,Unknown,But now he's gonna sleep with ours?
07x07,Unknown,"Psychologically speaking, it's perfectly normal to wind up with someone like your parents."
07x07,Unknown,"Thanks to my mom, I'll probably wind up with someone who loves my brother more than me."
07x07,Unknown,"Well, psychologically speaking, I'm gonna go throw up now."
07x07,Unknown,Oh...
07x07,Unknown,Ugh! This baby is making it so I can't button my pants anymore.
07x07,Unknown,"Big whoop. In 55 years, I don't think my dad buttoned his pants even once."
07x07,Unknown,"And somehow, despite sweet talk like that, I don't feel sexy anymore."
07x07,Unknown,Are you kidding?
07x07,Unknown,"I mean, you're-you're even sexier now that you're rounding out."
07x07,Unknown,(gasps)
07x07,Unknown,"I mean, you're even more sexy simply because there's so much more of you."
07x07,Unknown,(gasps)
07x07,Unknown,I'm never gonna get in the mood while your mammoth Eriksen seed is muffin-topping the bodiddly out of me.
07x07,Unknown,"Are you saying, ""No erky-erky until this baby pops out""?"
07x07,Unknown,"Okay, that's it."
07x07,Unknown,I-I am making it my mission to help you feel sexy again.
07x07,Unknown,I don't care how much more bloated you get.
07x07,Unknown,I'll get the next round!
07x07,Unknown,"Kevin! Yay, Kevin, thank you!"
07x07,Unknown,"So, Ted, you're cool with Kevin, right?"
07x07,Unknown,I know he's been over a lot lately.
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, yeah, Kevin's great."
07x07,Unknown,"I mean, there was, like, one weird thing the other day..."
07x07,Unknown,He was just standing there in his boxers?
07x07,Unknown,Yeah.
07x07,Unknown,I'll talk to him.
07x07,Unknown,Ted... be honest.
07x07,Unknown,"You'd bang Lily, right?"
07x07,Unknown,Narrator
07x07,Unknown,"So, later that night, Barney and Nora went skating."
07x07,Unknown,"Hey, kid, you know how your mom won't let you have ice cream till after dinner?"
07x07,Unknown,But then the waiting kind of makes it taste better?
07x07,Unknown,"Well, I've been waiting two months for that bowl of ice cream."
07x07,Unknown,"And tonight, I'm gonna have sex with it."
07x07,Unknown,"Look, Barney, one foot!"
07x07,Unknown,Oh!
07x07,Unknown,Narrator
07x07,Unknown,"Now, kids, for most guys, this would have meant the end of the date."
07x07,Unknown,But your Uncle Barney is not most guys.
07x07,Unknown,I can turn this around.
07x07,Unknown,"Well, I'm impressed that you know a 24-hour dentist."
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."
07x07,Unknown,"He can also give you tattoos, do your taxes and alter a suit."
07x07,Unknown,But I wouldn't trust him with a suit 'cause...
07x07,Unknown,(glugging)
07x07,Unknown,"Speaking of drinking, you want to...?"
07x07,Unknown,"No, Barney."
07x07,Unknown,Tonight's been a disaster.
07x07,Unknown,I think we should just call it a night.
07x07,Unknown,"No! Come on, Nora, your tooth can't be that bad. Let me see."
07x07,Unknown,W-Which is the fake one again?
07x07,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x07,Unknown,You look beautiful.
07x07,Unknown,Mmm.
07x07,Unknown,"All right, maybe I could go for one more drink."
07x07,Unknown,Great.
07x07,Unknown,(electric guitar riff plays)
07x07,Unknown,It's funny.
07x07,Unknown,Sometimes the most romantic moments can just creep up on you...
07x07,Unknown,(gasping)
07x07,Unknown,(whimpering)
07x07,Unknown,(rat squeals)
07x07,Unknown,(gasps)
07x07,Unknown,I can turn this around.
07x07,Unknown,"Hey, um, should've mentioned this before, but, um, Ted and I prefer that our guests remain fully clothed in the public areas of the apartment."
07x07,Unknown,Been some complaints.
07x07,Unknown,Did Ted say something?
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, th-there's been some complaints."
07x07,Unknown,"Not pointing any fingers or anything, but let's just keep those pants on, okay? Good talk."
07x07,"Well, if Ted said that, I've got something to complain about, too",Ted's nuts.
07x07,Unknown,"Okay, yes, Ted is a little neurotic, but I wouldn't say..."
07x07,Unknown,"No, no, no, I mean Ted's"
07x07,Unknown,nuts.
07x07,Unknown,Hi.
07x07,Unknown,Hey.
07x07,Unknown,(sighs)
07x07,Unknown,(sighs)
07x07,Unknown,So what? It's his apartment.
07x07,Unknown,You're taking his side?
07x07,Unknown,"Wait, this isn't one of those classic ""You still have feelings for your ex-boyfriend, ""who's oddly also your roommate, ""which for the record I'm totally cool with, ""even though everybody tells me I've walked into a bear trap"" things, is it?"
07x07,Unknown,"No, I just, I feel bad."
07x07,Unknown,Ted's going through some stuff right now.
07x07,Unknown,You eyeballing his deal is the most action he's gotten in months.
07x07,Unknown,I'll be nice to him.
07x07,Unknown,"So, I was trying to think of how to best express how sexy you are to me."
07x07,Unknown,A song? A poem?
07x07,And then it hit me,a board game!
07x07,Unknown,You just
07x07,Unknown,get
07x07,Unknown,women.
07x07,Unknown,"No, no, no, you'll like this."
07x07,Unknown,We answer risqué questions and perform spicy dares to slowly move up your shapely legs.
07x07,Unknown,I call it Chutes and Lilies.
07x07,Unknown,I would've guessed Monopo-Lily.
07x07,Unknown,"Yeah, that would've been better."
07x07,Unknown,"Okay, game play."
07x07,Unknown,"Roll the die to see who goes first, forfeit a turn on a pass--"
07x07,Unknown,intended for two-to-six players.
07x07,Unknown,Narrator
07x07,,As Marshall explained the many
07x07,Unknown,"rules of Chutes and Lilies, Lily thought back to what Kevin said in the bar."
07x07,Unknown,It's perfectly normal to wind up with someone like your parents.
07x07,Unknown,And then she thought of the only other man she knew who loved board games that much.
07x07,Unknown,I brought Diseases!
07x07,Unknown,Marshgammon.
07x07,Unknown,Dog Fight Promoter!
07x07,Unknown,Lilial Pursuit.
07x07,Unknown,And that's how you play the game.
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, wait."
07x07,Unknown,"I forgot to tell you what happens if I land on ""community chest."""
07x07,Unknown,Honk-honk.
07x07,Unknown,(laughs)
07x07,Unknown,(groans)
07x07,Unknown,"I just want to go home, take a long bath and go to bed."
07x07,Unknown,No!
07x07,Unknown,"I mean, come on."
07x07,Unknown,My place is so much closer.
07x07,Unknown,"I'll-I'll draw you a bath, pour you some champagne, we can forget all about this."
07x07,Unknown,"All right, that sounds good."
07x07,Unknown,(electric guitar riff plays)
07x07,Unknown,(sighs)
07x07,Unknown,That bath was wonderful.
07x07,Unknown,Thank you.
07x07,Unknown,Of course.
07x07,Unknown,"What do you say we go out on the balcony, get some fresh air?"
07x07,Unknown,"Ooh, that sounds lovely."
07x07,Unknown,What a beautiful view.
07x07,Unknown,I couldn't agree more.
07x07,Unknown,Man
07x07,,"Good-bye, cruel world!"
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, my God!"
07x07,Unknown,I can turn this around.
07x07,Unknown,Shh.
07x07,Unknown,(thud)
07x07,Unknown,Ooh!
07x07,Unknown,Ooh! Date night.
07x07,Unknown,"You know what? I'll just, just watch this in my room."
07x07,Unknown,"Already had dinner in there, why not a movie?"
07x07,Unknown,You should join us.
07x07,Unknown,"Yeah, join us."
07x07,Unknown,"No! No, no, no, no, no. Three's a crowd."
07x07,Unknown,"Besides, you guys wouldn't want to watch this anyway."
07x07,Unknown,Try us.
07x07,Unknown,"Well, have you seen"
07x07,Unknown,Die Hard?
07x07,Unknown,"Um, yes."
07x07,Unknown,"Okay, the guy who played Argyle produced this documentary about coin collecting."
07x07,Unknown,"Now, I know my sexy little lady can't resist a bubble bath, especially one with rose petals."
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, thanks, baby."
07x07,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x07,Unknown,(shudders)
07x07,Unknown,How about a sensual backrub?
07x07,Unknown,(shudders)
07x07,Unknown,Mm.
07x07,Unknown,Oh.
07x07,Unknown,"What's the matter, Lilypad?"
07x07,Unknown,You love my backrubs.
07x07,Unknown,Ah. I-I do... very much.
07x07,Unknown,"Good, because I got you a brand-"
07x07,Unknown,new... loofah!
07x07,Unknown,(crying)
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, yeah!"
07x07,Unknown,"Rubs... oh, yeah!"
07x07,Unknown,Trying to watch the coin documentary over here.
07x07,Unknown,"Hey, Ted, ever figure out who you're taking to that concert?"
07x07,Unknown,No.
07x07,Unknown,You want to go?
07x07,(whispers),Sure.
07x07,Unknown,Really?
07x07,Unknown,Awesome!
07x07,Unknown,It's a date!
07x07,Unknown,Narrator
07x07,Unknown,"Now, Kevin, as a trained psychologist, knew the appropriate way to voice his displeasure."
07x07,Unknown,I think we need to calmly discuss the relationship dynamics at play here.
07x07,Unknown,"I'm uncomfortable with how close you two are as roommates, given your particular romantic history."
07x07,Unknown,Narrator
07x07,Unknown,"Instead, he took a different approach."
07x07,Unknown,"Aw, hell no!"
07x07,Unknown,"If you can go on a date with my girlfriend, I don't have to wear pants in your apartment!"
07x07,Unknown,I can't wait till this baby comes out so we can get started on another one.
07x07,Unknown,"Then again, why wait? Ew, wait..."
07x07,Unknown,Get off of me!
07x07,Unknown,Damn it!
07x07,Unknown,"Ever since Kevin said it's normal to wind up with your parents, I... I keep picturing yo as my dad."
07x07,Unknown,"Lily, that theory is crazy-town."
07x07,Unknown,How do you know?
07x07,Unknown,"Because my mother is six-foot-three, she buys her clothes at the drugstore, and she prefers to trap her own dinner."
07x07,Unknown,"I love you more than anything, and you're nothing like her."
07x07,Unknown,Aw.
07x07,Unknown,"Now, that's how you turn a girl on."
07x07,Unknown,Mm...
07x07,Unknown,Mm...
07x07,Unknown,Narrator
07x07,Unknown,But then Marshall really started thinking about Kevin's theory.
07x07,Unknown,Midnight snack.
07x07,Unknown,Midnight snack.
07x07,Unknown,Mmm.
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, yeah...!"
07x07,Unknown,I am gonna rock... your... world.
07x07,Unknown,Yay.
07x07,Unknown,"If it's any consolation, the, uh... the guy stole my"
07x07,Unknown,Wall Street Journal
07x07,Unknown,once.
07x07,Unknown,So... guess the world's kind of a better place without...
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, God, this night's ruined."
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, come here, you."
07x07,Unknown,"Yes, it's been a very tough night, but I still think we can turn this around."
07x07,Unknown,Really?
07x07,Unknown,Why not?
07x07,Unknown,No sense in letting things get us down.
07x07,Unknown,How does that song go again?
07x07,Unknown,♪ Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens ♪
07x07,Unknown,♪ Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens ♪
07x07,Unknown,♪ Brown paper packages tied up with strings ♪

07x07,Unknown,"Mommy, no."
07x07,Unknown,"I want to thank you, baby, for reminding me of what a vivacious woman I am."
07x07,Unknown,Yeah.
07x07,Unknown,"No, uh, no need really."
07x07,Unknown,"Whoa, but I've been such a naughty girl."
07x07,Unknown,Maybe I need a spanking.
07x07,Unknown,Great. We'll... we'll just skip the board games and get right down to me making love to you.
07x07,Unknown,Oh...
07x07,Unknown,"Okay, good, 'cause I'm gonna ride you like an unbroken stallion."
07x07,Unknown,Okay.
07x07,Unknown,"Giddyup, cowgirl."
07x07,Unknown,"No, I can't go through with this!"
07x07,Unknown,"Thank God, me neither!"
07x07,Unknown,You're too much like my dad.
07x07,Unknown,You're too much like
07x07,Unknown,my
07x07,Unknown,dad.
07x07,Unknown,Your dad?!
07x07,Unknown,"Okay, dropping trou--"
07x07,Unknown,bad idea.
07x07,Unknown,We're moving on from that.
07x07,Unknown,This guy is a snake.
07x07,Unknown,What?! No.
07x07,Unknown,Ted? He's a nice guy.
07x07,Unknown,"A really, really nice guy."
07x07,Unknown,You should be more like him.
07x07,Unknown,"Mom, right on schedule."
07x07,Unknown,What?
07x07,Unknown,Nothing.
07x07,Unknown,"I'm just saying, you think he's so fragile, and yet... Whoa, whoa, whoa, fragile?"
07x07,Unknown,You think I'm fragile?
07x07,Unknown,"Yeah, fragile like a fox."
07x07,Unknown,"First, he tries scaring me off with his little peep show."
07x07,Unknown,Then he crashes our movie.
07x07,Unknown,"Now, he's got tickets to some super romantic concert."
07x07,Unknown,It's Weird Al Yankovic.
07x07,Unknown,"Okay. But still, who's the first person he asked to go with him?"
07x07,Unknown,My girlfriend.
07x07,Unknown,(laughs)
07x07,Unknown,"Oh, man. Okay."
07x07,Unknown,You think I'm the first person Ted asked?
07x07,Unknown,(laughs)
07x07,Unknown,"Ted, am I the first person you asked?"
07x07,Unknown,Marshall...!
07x07,Unknown,"You, me, Weird Al."
07x07,Unknown,"No thanks, Ted."
07x07,Unknown,Barney...!
07x07,Unknown,I got two tickets to Weird Al Yan...
07x07,Unknown,(phone beeps off)
07x07,Unknown,Barney?
07x07,Unknown,Lily...!
07x07,Unknown,Come on! You'll be the hottest girl there!
07x07,Unknown,"Okay, you'll be the only girl there."
07x07,Unknown,(phone beeps off)
07x07,Unknown,Stuart...!
07x07,Unknown,Claudia...!
07x07,Unknown,Brad...!
07x07,Unknown,Nat-alie...!
07x07,Unknown,Trudy...!
07x07,Unknown,Ranjit...!
07x07,Unknown,Carl the bartender...!
07x07,Unknown,Dude from my bodega...!
07x07,Unknown,Steam cleaning coupon guy...!
07x07,Unknown,Mom...!
07x07,Unknown,Please? I'll fly you out.
07x07,Unknown,I don't think so.
07x07,Unknown,"I'm sorry, sweet pea."
07x07,Unknown,Is Clint there?
07x07,Unknown,No.
07x07,Unknown,Wow. You really are pretty fragile.
07x07,Unknown,"Look, I'm trying to explain to you guys that I'm..."
07x07,Unknown,"Well, how do you expect me to feel?!"
07x07,Unknown,"I mean, all I want is for someone to go to a Weird Al concert with me, and I'm stuck going with my roommate."
07x07,Unknown,"Yeah, I might have to rain-check you there, buddy."
07x07,Unknown,I'm not a Weird Al fan.
07x07,Unknown,He's just a rip-off of Peculiar Jacques.
07x07,Unknown,"(accordion playing ""O Canada"")"
07x07,Unknown,(boing)
07x07,Unknown,Guess I'm going to this concert alone.
07x07,Unknown,I'll be that weird guy.
07x07,Unknown,"I mean, that other weird guy."
07x07,Unknown,"You know, there is one guy you didn't ask yet."
07x07,Unknown,Someone who happens to be the biggest Weird Al fan in the whole world.
07x07,Unknown,Kevin...?
07x07,Unknown,Ted...!
07x07,Unknown,"Oh! Oh, you are gonna flip when you see our tickets."
07x07,Unknown,They're in the shape of an accordion.
07x07,(falsetto),What?!
07x07,Unknown,"So, uh, you like Weird Al?"
07x07,Unknown,Not in the slightest.
07x07,Unknown,"No, dude, I'm the biggest Weird Al fan."
07x07,Unknown,"I know, I'm agreeing with you."
07x07,Unknown,"Do you know that I gave him the idea for ""Like a Surgeon."" Yeah."
07x07,Unknown,"Yeah. I wrote him a fan letter, and then a few months later..."
07x07,Unknown,All
07x07,,Bam! Top of the charts!
07x07,Unknown,You guys can eat it.
07x07,Unknown,Just... eat it.
07x07,Unknown,Hey.
07x07,Unknown,Hey.
07x07,Unknown,How'd it go with Nora?
07x07,Unknown,"Well, among other things, I realized Nora's a lot like my mom."
07x07,Unknown,"I'll bet that ruined things, huh?"
07x07,Unknown,(electric guitar riff plays)
07x07,Unknown,Come on. Barney Stinson always turns it around.
07x07,Unknown,How?
07x07,Unknown,Simple.
07x07,Unknown,I turned... it... around.
07x07,Unknown,Others
07x07,,Oh... Uh-huh? Uh-huh?
07x07,Unknown,"So the mom thing wasn't a total deal breaker, huh?"
07x07,Unknown,No!
07x07,Unknown,"Guys, my mom is the best person I know."
07x07,Unknown,"If Nora's even the tiniest bit like her, I'm a lucky guy."
07x07,Unknown,"Hey, you know what?"
07x07,Unknown,I'm a real lucky guy. 'Cause I married my dad.
07x07,Unknown,Aw.
07x07,Unknown,"So, uh, you want to go get luckier?"
07x07,Unknown,"Bye, guys."
07x07,Unknown,See ya.
07x07,Unknown,"So, what should we do now? ""We"" should do nothing."
07x07,Unknown,"You guys get out of here, go watch your movie."
07x07,Unknown,I'm fine. Really.
07x07,Unknown,You sure?
07x07,Unknown,Yeah.
07x07,Unknown,"Thanks, buddy."
07x07,Unknown,"Uh, hey... hey, Kevin."
07x07,Unknown,I think I'm a clone now.
07x07,Unknown,(laughs)
07x07,Unknown,I'm sorry.
07x07,Unknown,Were you just quoting Weird Al?
07x07,Unknown,I was indeed.
07x07,Unknown,I'm a huge Weird Al fan.
07x07,Unknown,"Well, then I need to buy you a drink."
07x07,Unknown,"I'll have a glass of champagne, sweet pea."
07x07,Unknown,One glass of champa--
07x07,Unknown,Sweet pea?
07x07,Unknown,Sure. Meeting a fellow Weird Al fan?
07x07,Unknown,That's cause for celebration.
07x07,Unknown,"Bottle of bubbly, coming right up!"
07x07,Unknown,(chuckles)

07x08,Unknown,"Once upon a time at a Halloween party, I met a girl dressed like a pumpkin... a slutty pumpkin."
07x08,Unknown,And she was extraordinary.
07x08,Unknown,"But she gave me her number on a Kit Kat bar,"
07x08,Unknown,which was tragically given away
07x08,Unknown,as Halloween candy.
07x08,Unknown,So every year I return to that same party hoping I'd see her again.
07x08,Unknown,"But with every passing October,"
07x08,Unknown,that hope grew a little dimmer.
07x08,Unknown,"Then one day, after ten years of searching..."
07x08,Unknown,"This might sound creepy, but do you have a record of who rented it in 2001?"
07x08,Unknown,"Wow, that was easy."
07x08,Unknown,You're not the first lovelorn young man to walk through that door.
07x08,Unknown,Three girls got proposals off my wife's slutty artichoke costume.
07x08,Unknown,"Two others disappeared, but I focus on the positive."
07x08,Unknown,I couldn't believe it. I actually had her address.

07x08,Unknown,"Halloween, ten years ago."
07x08,Unknown,Now that's a slow play.
07x08,Unknown,"The next day, Lily and Marshall headed out to Lily's grandparents for dinner."

07x08,Unknown,"Say basset hounds, Pretzel Crisps, anything but..."
07x08,Unknown,...you.
07x08,Unknown,"Oh, God, just kiss him before he proposes."
07x08,Unknown,"Ted, I've been looking for the Hot Hanging Chad for the last nine Halloweens."
07x08,Unknown,"I've waded through a sweaty parade of Big Lebowskis, Harry Potters, Antoine Dodsons, and that jackass who always dresses as laundry."
07x08,Unknown,"Oh, I hate that guy."
07x08,Unknown,"That's why, once I finally found you..."
07x08,Unknown,...it was hard to let you go.
07x08,Unknown,"Good-bye, Ted."
07x08,Unknown,Let's just not touch ever again.
07x08,Unknown,"Probably a good idea, yeah."
07x08,Unknown,Okay.
07x08,Unknown,Narrator
07x08,Unknown,"Kids, after spending a decade dreaming of the wrong girl, I wanted more than ever for the next woman I met to be the real thing."
07x08,Unknown,"Yeah, I don't know, Barney, she doesn't seem like my type."
07x08,Unknown,I will k*ll you.
07x08,Unknown,I'll see what I can do.
07x08,Unknown,(mouthing)
07x08,Unknown,(grunting)
07x08,(Canadian accent),"Oh, hey there, I'm Barney, how are you?"
07x08,Unknown,"No,"
07x08,Unknown,I'm
07x08,Unknown,Barney.
07x08,Unknown,Whoa.
07x08,Unknown,You pack quite a wallop there.
07x08,Unknown,Hope you didn't hurt your hand.
07x08,Unknown,Why are you so nice?
07x08,Unknown,(grunts)
07x08,Unknown,"Oh, sorry about my thick noodle there."
07x08,Unknown,"How about we split the cost of the vase, eh?"
07x08,Unknown,(grunts)
07x08,Unknown,Holy Zamboni.
07x08,Unknown,"Wow, you really put your weight behind that one."
07x08,Unknown,That was a really good one.
07x08,Unknown,"Oh, heavens to Gretzky, that was a real Chiclet rattler."
07x09,Unknown,♪ ♪
07x09,Unknown,Psst. In here!
07x09,Unknown,I'm safe. Not quite.
07x09,Unknown,"The amulet, please, Mr. Stinson."
07x09,Unknown,Why?
07x09,Unknown,Help! Help! The kid.
07x09,Unknown,"Help! Hang on, kid."
07x09,Unknown,Grab my tie.
07x09,Unknown,But you're not supposed to take the tie off.
07x09,Unknown,You lost a bet with your friends Lily and Marshall which requires you to wear the tie for a full year.
07x09,Unknown,"If it means saving your life, I think they'll understand!"
07x09,Unknown,They sound like nice people!
07x09,Unknown,"Yeah, they are."
07x09,Unknown,Grab that...
07x09,Unknown,Come on.
07x09,Unknown,That's it.
07x09,Unknown,"Thanks, Mister."
07x09,Unknown,How can I repay you?
07x09,Unknown,"You can stay in school, that's how."
07x09,Unknown,No!
07x09,Unknown,True story.
07x09,Unknown,"But golly, I'm just gonna miss the heck out of that ducky tie. I really am."
07x09,Unknown,Look what I just found in the trash.
07x09,Unknown,No!
07x09,Unknown,"Kids, you haven't truly lived until somewhere, somebody puts a sign up because of something you did. For instance..."
07x09,Unknown,"Have you guys seen that sign out front that says ""Absolutely No Boogie-Boarding""?"
07x09,Unknown,What's that all about?
07x09,Unknown,"Oh, that's a great story. You got time for it?"
07x09,Unknown,"Well, I'm supposed to go to my mom's birthday party, so... please make it as long as you can."
07x09,Unknown,"Well, it happened a few months ago."
07x09,Unknown,The night of the hurricane...
07x09,Unknown,"Kids, it was August 26, 2011, and Hurricane Irene was barreling towards New York."
07x09,Unknown,"Guys, guys, guys."
07x09,Unknown,And a Boy Scout is always what?
07x09,Unknown,Unpopular? Beaten up?
07x09,Unknown,Going to the movies with his mom?
07x09,Unknown,A Boy Scout is always prepared.
07x09,Unknown,Prepared to spend lunch in his locker?
07x09,Unknown,Prepared to die a virgin?
07x09,Unknown,Prepared to paint his sister's nails?
07x09,Unknown,Prepared for emergencies!
07x09,Unknown,"That's why a week ago, when Irene was just a tropical depression-"
07x09,Unknown,You're a tropical depression.
07x09,Unknown,"This guy got us... a disaster backpack, and a rental car that seats five, parked right outside."
07x09,Unknown,We're gonna drive up to my place in Westchester where we'll all be safe.
07x09,Unknown,Boy Scouted! You're welcome.
07x09,Unknown,"Ted's right, we should go."
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, on the way out of the city, do you mind if we stop at my place so I can get something?"
07x09,Unknown,"Okay, what did you have to get?"
07x09,Unknown,My drink on. We're not going anywhere.
07x09,Unknown,What? No!
07x09,Unknown,We don't have time for this! We gotta get going!
07x09,Unknown,"Ted, I'm older than you. Yeah."
07x09,Unknown,And taller. Just older.
07x09,Unknown,"And when you reach my age, and height, you'll see that things like this hurricane are no big deal."
07x09,Unknown,They're going to close the bridges.
07x09,Unknown,"You guys, we got to get out of here."
07x09,Unknown,I'm afraid I'm with blondie on this one.
07x09,Unknown,This storm is nothing. I'm from Vancouver.
07x09,Unknown,You know what we call this in the Couv?
07x09,Unknown,Barbecue weather.
07x09,Unknown,"Yeah, I'm with these guys."
07x09,Unknown,Drinking beer in front of Barney's giant TV beats sitting in the car
07x09,Unknown,listening to Memoires of a Geisha.
07x09,Unknown,"Come on, we're at the best part."
07x09,Unknown,"Oh, it's my mom, checking to see if I'm okay."
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, Mom."
07x09,Unknown,"Ooh, Mommy! It's drizzling out!"
07x09,Unknown,I'm so scared!
07x09,Unknown,Bikini weather.
07x09,Unknown,"Marshall, you're with me, right?"
07x09,Unknown,"Sorry, old friend."
07x09,Unknown,But I can't afford to tempt fate.
07x09,Unknown,"Oh right, I was being really weird."
07x09,Unknown,I should explain.
07x09,Unknown,Last summer I quit my job.
07x09,Unknown,"And then, a week before the hurricane..."
07x09,Unknown,"Huh, my medical insurance just expired."
07x09,Unknown,That gives me two uninsured weeks before I'm added to your plan.
07x09,Unknown,It's no biggie.
07x09,Unknown,Ow! Paper cut.
07x09,Unknown,Death is all around us.
07x09,Unknown,So for the next two weeks he was basically a really clingy Edgar Allan Poe.
07x09,Unknown,The Grim Reaper beckons.
07x09,Unknown,"I feel his icy grip around my throat, the breath of his hounds at my heels, the unrelenting rat-tat-tat of his scythe on my chamber door."
07x09,Unknown,"And you, with your blithe request, you only hasten his inevitable triumph."
07x09,Unknown,Is that what you desire?
07x09,Unknown,"Is that what you desire, Lily?"
07x09,Unknown,I just wanted you to get us some bagels.
07x09,Unknown,Bagels?!
07x09,Unknown,Do you have any idea what could happen to me whilst getting bagels?!
07x09,Unknown,"What the...?! No, not like this!"
07x09,Unknown,Fine. I'll go get the bagels.
07x09,Unknown,No!
07x09,Unknown,Why not?
07x09,Unknown,"And remember, not too much cream cheese."
07x09,Unknown,"Half a shmear, max."
07x09,Unknown,"Thanks, baby."
07x09,Unknown,No! No! Not like this!
07x09,Unknown,"Okay, now you're just being ridiculous."
07x09,Unknown,"Well, life is ridiculous, Lily!"
07x09,Unknown,"People get run over by buses and hit in the nuts by skateboards, bitten by babies."
07x09,Unknown,"Nobody wakes up and says, ""Today I'm gonna star in a YouTube video."""
07x09,Unknown,You've said that at least a dozen times.
07x09,Unknown,"Lily, for the next two weeks you must be by my side protecting me."
07x09,Unknown,"Why, what's gonna happen?"
07x09,Answer,a hurricane.
07x09,Unknown,Just let me take off the tie! Please!
07x09,Unknown,I have to wear this at work.
07x09,Unknown,Do you have any idea what that's like?
07x09,Unknown,"If the SEC pursues charges, it's going to be all our asses."
07x09,Unknown,Nobody takes this more seriously than I do.
07x09,Unknown,"Please, can I take it off?"
07x09,Unknown,You... may... knot.
07x09,Unknown,"With a ""K."""
07x09,Unknown,A little tie pun.
07x09,Unknown,This is far from over.
07x09,Unknown,"You have a price, Eriksen, and I will find it."
07x09,Unknown,"When the end of day is nigh, I'll have taken off this tie."
07x09,Unknown,"I'm going to like the way I look, I guarantee it."
07x09,Unknown,So boogie-boarding...
07x09,Unknown,Boogie-boarding. So I was trying to get these guys to leave.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, Nerdlinger, what's with the safety boner?"
07x09,Unknown,"I mean, come on."
07x09,Unknown,"The disaster kit, the car, the ladies' rain boots-"
07x09,Unknown,"Uh, they're men's."
07x09,Unknown,Pink is just easier to spot from the rescue chopper.
07x09,Unknown,"Look, forgive me for caring about you guys, but you're my best friends in the world and I just want to make sure you're okay."
07x09,Unknown,"Ah. Ted, you are a giant whining bummer."
07x09,Unknown,Barney...
07x09,Unknown,"Come on, Ted, this storm is not a big deal."
07x09,Unknown,This storm is a big deal.
07x09,Unknown,Let's replay that harrowing footage of Irene touching down in North Carolina.
07x09,Unknown,We gotta get out of here!
07x09,Unknown,"Go, go! Come on, come on!"
07x09,Unknown,Please let me take it off! No.
07x09,Unknown,"$5,000? No."
07x09,Unknown,Is he serious?
07x09,Unknown,"$10,000?"
07x09,Unknown,"No. Dudes, take the money."
07x09,Unknown,"$20,000? No."
07x09,Unknown,Yes. I'll let you slap me in the face as hard as you can. You have my attention.
07x09,Unknown,"Kids, you remember Marshall and Barney's slap bet. A few years earlier, Barney lost a bet to Marshall. His penalty was five slaps delivered anyplace, anytime. So far, Marshall had slapped Barney four times. Which meant he only had one slap left."
07x09,Unknown,"What do you say, Marshall? Are you going to seize this slap-ortunity or let it slap through your fingers?"
07x09,Unknown,"Don't let him tempt you, Marshall."
07x09,Unknown,"I don't know, Lily. I mean we have a baby on the way."
07x09,Unknown,An extra slap could really come in handy.
07x09,Unknown,No! No!
07x09,Unknown,This is crazy.
07x09,Unknown,You having to wear that tie for another ten months is all the satisfaction I need.
07x09,Unknown,"Plus, I still have one slap left, and that feels good. But if you didn't have that slap left-"
07x09,Unknown,"if say, I were to get you to slap me tonight-"
07x09,Unknown,I suppose that would change everything.
07x09,Unknown,I suppose it would.
07x09,Unknown,Le jeu commence. Je m'appelle Marshall.
07x09,Unknown,So boogie-boarding... Boogie-boarding.
07x09,Unknown,"So I was trying to get these guys to leave, but there was one little problem."
07x09,Unknown,"Come on, let's go."
07x09,Unknown,I'm staying.
07x09,Unknown,What?! Barney?!
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, hey, it's going to get pretty crazy out there."
07x09,Unknown,"And if some hot woman gets all her clothes blown off, and I'm not up here to videotape it and put it up on the Internet, who will, FEMA?"
07x09,Unknown,"Come on, open your eyes."
07x09,Unknown,"No, no, you are coming with us."
07x09,Unknown,We leave no man behind.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, Mom."
07x09,Unknown,"Uh, yeah, the boots were a big hit."
07x09,Unknown,"You know, I better pee."
07x09,Unknown,"But when Lily and I get back, we're all leaving."
07x09,Unknown,"Wait, I have to go pee with you?"
07x09,Unknown,"You want me to go to the ""bathroom,"" the most dangerous room in the house by myself?"
07x09,Unknown,Do you have any idea what could happen?
07x09,Unknown,Ow! My eye!
07x09,Unknown,I'm blind!
07x09,Unknown,"No, no! Not like this!"
07x09,Unknown,I don't think we're seeing eye to eye about the likelihood of that happening.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, it's my dad."
07x09,Unknown,My dad's calling me.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, do you know where...? Ted got his boots?"
07x09,Unknown,Yeah. They're fabulous. I totally want a pair.
07x09,Unknown,"Okay, Dad, I will. Thanks."
07x09,Unknown,"Guys, Dad says this hurricane is a bigger deal than you thought."
07x09,Unknown,I'm taking charge. We are getting out of here.
07x09,Unknown,"Okay, what is with everybody's parents calling to check up on them?"
07x09,Unknown,It's just a little rain.
07x09,Unknown,Lawn-mowing weather.
07x09,Unknown,Bocce weather.
07x09,Unknown,Wow. You're really bummed that your dad's not worried about you.
07x09,Unknown,What?!
07x09,Unknown,Eh... What would my dad be worried about?
07x09,Unknown,That I'm not wearing enough sunblock?
07x09,Unknown,House-painting weather.
07x09,Unknown,"Ted, you're back."
07x09,Unknown,I've changed my mind. I'm in. Let's go.
07x09,Unknown,"Yeah, I changed my mind, too. You can't come."
07x09,Unknown,"Everybody else, we're moving out."
07x09,Unknown,That's harsh.
07x09,Unknown,You know what else is harsh? Ultraviolet light.
07x09,Unknown,I fell asleep in the tanning bed this week and I think I got a sunburn on my cheek.
07x09,Unknown,It's so sensitive.
07x09,Unknown,"It's like a big, red bull's-eye."
07x09,Unknown,Ouchie.
07x09,Unknown,Did you take my blush out of my purse?
07x09,Unknown,"So, boogie-boarding."
07x09,Unknown,Boogie-boarding.
07x09,Unknown,"Oh, come on, Ted, you can't just leave him here."
07x09,Unknown,"Uh, yeah, I can."
07x09,Unknown,You called me a giant whining bummer.
07x09,Unknown,You're not allowed in my car.
07x09,Unknown,You don't get to find out if the geisha finds love.
07x09,Unknown,This is about principle.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, Ted. I'm ready to go."
07x09,Unknown,"And you must be ""Principle."""
07x09,Unknown,"Ah, on a separate note, guys, this is Maya."
07x09,Unknown,I just met her out in the hall.
07x09,Unknown,"We have a lot in common, such as our mutual love of country music, NASCAR and Jeff Foxworthy. Just go with it."
07x09,Unknown,"She needed a ride out of the city, and we have an extra seat in the car, so..."
07x09,Unknown,"Okay, let's hit it!"
07x09,Unknown,Wow.
07x09,Unknown,It's come to this.
07x09,Unknown,"You could help a friend, but instead, you're choosing the hot girl in the tight t*nk top."
07x09,Unknown,Your training is complete!
07x09,Unknown,I'm so proud of this kid!
07x09,Unknown,"But seriously, the storm's coming in, so dump the hoochie and wheels up."
07x09,Unknown,You promised me a seat.
07x09,Unknown,"Oh, for God's sake."
07x09,Unknown,You two both go. I'll stay here.
07x09,Unknown,"What? Lily, no! Shotgun!"
07x09,Unknown,You're staying. Then Lily can come! Wha...?
07x09,Unknown,"No, no, no, I'll stay here. Why?"
07x09,Unknown,I just want some time away from you!
07x09,Unknown,What?
07x09,Unknown,"Marshall, I'm sorry. I love you, but I haven't had a second alone in weeks!"
07x09,Unknown,It's summer vacation!
07x09,Unknown,"All I want to do is sit in the bathtub and read a book, but now..."
07x09,Unknown,"Baby, I forgot to bring a book."
07x09,Unknown,Do you mind reading yours out loud?
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, it's been no picnic for me either."
07x09,Unknown,You don't even do the voices.
07x09,Unknown,Blocked number.
07x09,Unknown,Hello?
07x09,Unknown,RJ? It's your father.
07x09,Unknown,Daddy?
07x09,Unknown,I love you.
07x09,Unknown,It means so much that you called.
07x09,Unknown,Ha! I knew that you wanted him to call. Busted!
07x09,Unknown,That was you?
07x09,Unknown,I really think you should slap him.
07x09,Unknown,You should slap him!
07x09,Unknown,Slap him. Slap him.
07x09,Unknown,"Two cheeks, no waiting."
07x09,Unknown,"Good, 'cause I really think I'm gonna slap him!"
07x09,Unknown,"So, boog -boarding?"
07x09,Unknown,Boogie-boarding.
07x09,Unknown,"Come on, Ted."
07x09,Unknown,"You're gonna give some random floozy a ride, but not take Barney?"
07x09,Unknown,Floozy?!
07x09,Unknown,"If she's going, I'm not going!"
07x09,Unknown,"Lily, you're staying. Let's go."
07x09,Unknown,"If Lily's staying, then I'm staying!"
07x09,Unknown,Then I'm going. Then I'm going.
07x09,Unknown,"You can't go, Marshall, 'cause I'm going."
07x09,Unknown,"If Barney's going, I'm not going! Then I can go."
07x09,Unknown,Then I'm staying. Then I'm staying.
07x09,Unknown,Then I'm going.
07x09,Unknown,Then I'm not going.
07x09,Unknown,"Okay, you know what? I'm going."
07x09,Unknown,This storm's been on Doppler radar for a week.
07x09,Unknown,I'm the only one who prepared for it.
07x09,Unknown,And you all made fun of me. So guess what?
07x09,Unknown,This Boy Scout is taking a hike. Good-bye!
07x09,Unknown,"Maya, real quick, did you think there was anything here, or..."
07x09,Unknown,"Oh, I have a boyfriend."
07x09,Unknown,Good-bye!
07x09,Unknown,"Um, Ted...?"
07x09,Unknown,The time for evacuation is over.
07x09,Unknown,"Everyone should now go inside and be prepared to stay inside until weather conditions improve, which won't likely be until Sunday afternoon."
07x09,Unknown,We're stuck here?
07x09,Unknown,"Okay, let's not panic."
07x09,Unknown,You know what? Let's panic.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, if we don't make it through the night, I want you guys to know, and I really mean this..."
07x09,Unknown,I wish I had branched out and made more friends in my 20s.
07x09,Unknown,"Well, I'm going to go to the bathroom."
07x09,Unknown,"By myself, I guess."
07x09,Unknown,Watch out for bears.
07x09,Unknown,"Since this might be the end, I gotta confess something."
07x09,Unknown,Can I?
07x09,Unknown,Might as well.
07x09,Unknown,Barney and I have been doing the wild thing... this whole time.
07x09,Unknown,Except a brief period last year when he was shacking up with Marshall's mom.
07x09,Unknown,"But luckily, three-ways were on the menu, so..."
07x09,Unknown,"Marshall, you know she didn't say any of that, right?"
07x09,Unknown,"I know, but I just want to slap him so bad!"
07x09,Unknown,But that tie is so stupid! But the slap would feel so good!
07x09,Unknown,But he hates that tie so much!
07x09,Unknown,Perhaps I can help.
07x09,"Marshall, ask yourself this question",why today?
07x09,Unknown,"He hasn't said anything about that tie for weeks, and yet, suddenly today, he can't wear it another second?"
07x09,Unknown,"No, there's a reason."
07x09,Unknown,You've got something coming up.
07x09,Unknown,"Something where you're on display, vulnerable... exposed."
07x09,Unknown,It's not work-related.
07x09,Unknown,"No, this is relationship stuff."
07x09,Unknown,You're trying to impress someone.
07x09,Unknown,"In the lie you told, you said you were being chased by two g*ons."
07x09,Unknown,So it's two people.
07x09,Unknown,"A couple, perhaps."
07x09,Unknown,You're meeting Nora's parents tomorrow!
07x09,Unknown,Wrong!
07x09,Unknown,"Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong!"
07x09,Unknown,"It's in two days, and I really want them to like me!"
07x09,Unknown,Oh-ho! Therapisted!
07x09,Unknown,Shrinked? Shrunk?
07x09,Unknown,We'll figure it out.
07x09,Unknown,"So, boogie-boarding."
07x09,Unknown,Boogie-boarding.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, Lily, can I talk to you for just a second?"
07x09,Unknown,Come here.
07x09,Unknown,"Marshall, if I'm in here to brush your teeth, I swear to..."
07x09,Unknown,I'm sorry that I've been so needy lately.
07x09,Unknown,I know that you need some time alone.
07x09,Unknown,So... I'll be in the other room.
07x09,Unknown,You're not going anywhere.
07x09,Unknown,Mmm... Hey...
07x09,Unknown,"And the funny thing is, after that night, we'll never be alone again."
07x09,Unknown,You made that in my bathroom?
07x09,Unknown,Whoops.
07x09,Unknown,"Wow, a hurricane baby."
07x09,Unknown,"Oh, man, Hurricane Eriksen would be a sweet name."
07x09,Unknown,It would be a crazy sweet name!
07x09,Unknown,"Thanks, Ted."
07x09,Unknown,"Anyway, the next day, after the danger had passed..."
07x09,Unknown,It's closed.
07x09,Unknown,Now what?
07x09,Unknown,A Boy Scout is always prepared.
07x09,Unknown,Hey!
07x09,Unknown,Nice!
07x09,Unknown,To surviving the hurricane.
07x09,Unknown,Yay!
07x09,Unknown,I love you guys. Love you.
07x09,Unknown,"I did finally make it up here to the house later that week only to find that a falling oak tree had landed in the living room. If we'd been here, it would have crushed us like bugs. You see, kids, there's no way of knowing for sure where the safest place is... so the best you can hope for is to have some good company."
07x09,Unknown,"Guys, how far do you think I can boogie-board on this thing?"
07x09,Unknown,So far!
07x09,Unknown,"Marshall, your insurance doesn't kick in till tomorrow."
07x09,Unknown,"Yeah, well, you know what?"
07x09,Unknown,Life kicks in right now.
07x09,Unknown,♪ ♪
07x09,Unknown,"Don't worry, he wasn't hurt..."
07x09,Unknown,the first time. I have splints! The second time he went through the front window of Maclaren's.
07x09,Unknown,"Hence the ""No Boogie-boarding"" sign."
07x09,Unknown,"All right, guys, I gotta go."
07x09,Unknown,"Barney, good luck with Nora's parents."
07x09,Unknown,Bye. Bye.
07x09,Unknown,See you later.
07x09,Unknown,All right. See you. See ya.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, Barney?"
07x09,Unknown,Hmm?
07x09,Unknown,"Listen, um, we made a baby in your bathroom."
07x09,Unknown,So we owe you one.
07x09,Unknown,So we say... you can take off the ducky tie.
07x09,Unknown,For three slaps.
07x09,Unknown,Three slaps?
07x09,Unknown,"And to be clear, this would add three slaps to Marshall's existing one, giving him four slaps in total."
07x09,Unknown,Deal.
07x09,Unknown,I'm free!
07x09,Unknown,"God, this feels so good!"
07x09,Unknown,This was a mistake!
07x09,Unknown,I wanna put the tie back on!
07x09,Unknown,I wanna put the tie back on!
07x09,Unknown,Why do I have to be Barney right now?
07x09,Unknown,Three slaps remaining!
07x09,Unknown,"Three slaps. Wow, I like the sound of that."
07x09,Unknown,"I think I'll save those bad boys, you know, for a rainy day."
07x09,Unknown,Okay. The worst is over.
07x09,Unknown,Ah!
07x09,Unknown,Two slaps remaining!
07x09,Unknown,It's all right.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, it's all done... for now."
07x09,Unknown,I think I need to go home and reevaluate how I make life decisions.
07x09,Unknown,Come on. I have to go back to work.
07x09,Unknown,Let's split a cab. Okay. Yeah.
07x09,Unknown,Did you ever tell those guys about that other thing that almost happened?
07x09,Unknown,That other thing?
07x09,Unknown,"Oh, that. No. Did you?"
07x09,Unknown,No.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, I'm really sorry about that phone call."
07x09,Unknown,"Oh, it's fine."
07x09,Unknown,"No, it is so not fine. I was a jerk."
07x09,Unknown,"And if you don't mind my saying, your dad is a complete idiot for not calling."
07x09,Unknown,He should never let a day go by without calling you because when I let a day go by without talking to you...
07x09,Unknown,"Um, that day's just no good."
07x09,Unknown,"Um, sorry."
07x09,Unknown,Um...
07x09,Unknown,It's my dad.
07x09,Unknown,"Wait, show me your hands."
07x09,Unknown,My hands.
07x09,Unknown,"Hey, Dad!"
07x09,Unknown,That's what I've been saying!
07x09,Unknown,Golf weather!
07x09,Unknown,Can you believe we almost...?
07x09,Unknown,I know.
07x09,Unknown,Good thing we didn't.
07x09,Unknown,"Yeah. I mean, not long after that you got together with Nora."
07x09,Unknown,And you met Kevin.
07x09,Unknown,Yeah. Disaster averted.
07x09,Unknown,Exactly.
07x09,Unknown,It would've ruined everything if we'd been all... ah-la-la-la...
07x09,Unknown,"I know, right? So dumb..."
07x09,Unknown,La-la-la-la-la-la...
07x10,Older Ted,"Kids, Einstein was right. Time moves at different speeds. To Barney, the previous night raced by in a blur. But then, all of a sudden, time stopped."
07x10,Robin,This might be the worst thing I've ever done.
07x10,Barney,"Hey, now, you weren't at the top of your game, but it was still pretty..."
07x10,Robin,"Oh, my God! I just cheated on Kevin. He is the nicest guy ever. I'm a terrible person."
07x10,Barney,It's okay. We both cheated. What's that saying about two wrongs making a right?
07x10,Robin,"""Two wrongs don't make a right""?"
07x10,Barney,"No, that's not it. Oh, my God. I just cheated on Nora. How could I do this to her? What are we gonna do?"
07x10,Robin,"I don't know. Well... Can I ask you, did this mean anything?"
07x10,Barney,"Of course, it did. Of course, it didn't. Which one are you looking for? I could see it going either way."
07x10,Robin,It meant nothing.
07x10,Barney,It meant nothing!
07x10,Robin,How could you say it meant nothing?!
07x10,Barney,"Of course, it meant something!"
07x10,Robin,"No, it didn't! It can't. (Barney groans) Okay? You're with Nora, and I'm with Kevin and... I have to go."
07x10,Barney,"Wait, what are we gonna tell them?"
07x10,Robin,Nothing. God! We made a horrible mistake. But it-it is over now. There's no reason to hurt more people by talking about it.
07x10,Barney,You're asking me to lie? That's... fine.
07x10,Robin,Damn it. Nora and I have that work cruise tomorrow night. We’re all supposed to go together.
07x10,Barney,"Okay, I know this is thinking way, way out of the box, but what if-- and hear me out--we don't go?"
07x10,Robin,"No. I just want this whole night to fade into history, so we have to act like it never happened. We should go. I mean, it's a three-hour boat ride-- what could happen?"
07x10,Barney,I'm sure that's what Gilligan say.
07x10,Unknown,Theme song starts
07x10,Ted,"Groovapalooza! All the smug hippie bands from the '90s in one big concert (sniffs) Ah, even the tickets smell like cloves and mediocrity. And, to really take us back, I scored us bag of, yes, mari..."
07x10,Older Ted,"Kids, we used to do something before concerts to enjoy them more. And that thing was to... eat a sandwich."
07x10,Ted,"...nated steak subs. Oh, yeah!"
07x10,Lily,"Well, as future parents, we'll pass on the sandwiches."
07x10,Marshall,"How could you even suggest such a thing, Ted?! (whispers) I better get my 60 bucks back."
07x10,Ted,"No sandwich? Marshall, it's a palooza. We've eaten sandwiches at every palooza. Lollapalooza, Funkapalooza..."
07x10,Lily,"Gender-diversity-awareness-palooza, junior year."
07x10,Ted,"Yeah, there were some real b*tches there."
07x10,Ted,"Okay, quick, before Lily gets here, let's fire this up."
07x10,Marshall,No way. I promised Lily that I would be responsible.
07x10,Ted,You're not getting your 60 bucks back.
07x10,Marshall,Give me that. (coughing)
07x10,Unknown,(Piano playing soft music)
07x10,Barney,"Hey, how you holding up? Well, I'm about to be trapped on boat all night with the guy I cheated on, the guy I cheated with and the girl that the guy I cheated with cheated on. So, not super. Hi, Sandy."
07x10,Sandy,You're welcome.
07x10,Robin,"I did not say ""Thank you."""
07x10,Sandy,"Oh, you're too kind. Too kind. Excuse me, I should really try to have sex with that new intern."
07x10,Older Ted,"Robin's boss, Sandy Rivers hosted this cruise every year, mostly to hit on the new employees. And he'd found a clever way to never spend a cent."
07x10,Sandy,"Up next, another four deaths in Arizona's record-breaking heat wave. You want real record-breaking heat? Try Kristoff's Jalapeño Coconut Vodka martini. Muy caliente!"
07x10,Robin,"Okay, Nora and Kevin are gonna be here any minute. I thought I could handle this, but I can't."
07x10,Barney,"Okay, um, here's the plan. We'll grab one of the lifeboats, get back to shore, destroy the tape of us doing it..."
07x10,Robin,There's a tape of us doing it?
07x10,Barney,"...and we'll start a new life together. Somewhere simple and homey, like Vermont or Dubai."
07x10,Robin,"Wait, is that what you want? For us to be together?"
07x10,Kevin,"Hey, Robin."
07x10,Robin,"Oh, God, I really can't do this."
07x10,Barney,Don't worry. Just follow my lead and keep cool.
07x10,Nora,"Hey, guys!"
07x10,Barney,(whispers) They know!
07x10,Marshall,"Oh, no. I think that sandwich was laced with other stuff. Like, hard meats."
07x10,Ted,What do you mean?
07x10,Marshall,"Well, usually after a sandwich, I feel paranoid. But I'm not. Why am I not feeling paranoid?!"
07x10,Ted,"What do you mean? Calm down, dude! We'll be fine."
07x10,Marshall,Lily's gonna know.
07x10,Ted,Listen to me. Whatever we were just talking about... we'll be fine.
07x10,Marshall,"You're right, she won't find out."
07x10,Lily,"Hey, guys!"
07x10,Marshall,(whispers) She knows!
07x10,Unknown,Back to the boat party.
07x10,Sandy,Good evening. A special welcome to our four new interns: Erika... and so on. One safety matter: life preservers are on the side rails in case anyone falls overboard. That's it. Have a good night. Don't drink too much. Or do.
07x10,Robin,"Beautiful night, huh, g*ng?"
07x10,Barney,"Yeah, Robin and I were just cheating--chatting about how warm it is. I'm breaking a trust-- sweat in here. (Nervous laugh) And I thought we'd be “cuckold”."
07x10,Kevin,"I know why you're so nervous, Barney."
07x10,Barney,You do?
07x10,Kevin,"You're meeting Nora's parents tomorrow night, right?"
07x10,Barney,(laughs) That's it! That's it!
07x10,Robin,Let's dance!
07x10,Barney,Bah! Whoo!
07x10,Marshall,(Whispers to Lily) Lily has no idea I'm high.
07x10,Lily,You're high?
07x10,Marshall,I'm sorry. (Whispers to Ted) Lily has no idea I'm high.
07x10,Lily,"Okay, well, if your pregnant wife has to sit here sober all night, she's gonna need some of them nachos."
07x10,Marshall,"You got it. (Turns to the guy next to them eating nachos) Hey, dude, fork over some of them nach..."
07x10,Lily,"No, not his. My own."
07x10,Marshall,"Ah. Smart. Come on, Ted."
07x10,Ted,What?
07x10,Older Ted,"And thus began the most harrowing journey of our lives. To this day, Robin and Barney swear this is the song they danced to that night."

07x10,Older Ted,Marshall and I were still in line to get Lily's nachos.
07x10,Ted,"Dude, we've been waiting forever."
07x10,Marshall,"Even worse, this is the line for the ladies’ room. I can't believe that our last Groovapalooza was, what, 12 years ago? I mean, time is going by so fast."
07x10,Ted,"I know, it's crazy. In, like, an eye blink, this hand will be, like, an old man's hand."
07x10,Marshall,"I recognize the clichéd nature of what I'm about to say, but... whoa!"
07x10,Ted,"Yeah. 312? That's our gate. Dude, we just walked around the entire arena."
07x10,Marshall,"We've been walking for, like, an hour and we still haven't found the nachos. I bet Lily is so upset."
07x10,Unknown,Flashback
07x10,Guy with nachos,"Yo, you want my nachos, bro?"
07x10,Lily,"Thank you. My husband's been gone an hour looking for these. If he can't even do that, how can I trust him as a father?"
07x10,Guy with nachos,"You can't, bro. You can't."
07x10,Lily,I like your long goatee. Marshall can't even grow a beard.
07x10,Guy with nachos,"Oh, that's sad. 'Cause one's ability to grow facial hair directly correlates with one's ability to be a good father."
07x10,Lily,I know it does. I know it does.
07x10,Marshall,"(groans) Oh. Excuse me, sir. Do you know where the nachos are?"
07x10,Unknown,(ominous music plays)
07x10,Unknown,(screaming)
07x10,Ted,Marshall! Over here. I found the nacho line.
07x10,Marshall,Oh.
07x10,Unknown,Back on the boat.
07x10,Barney,"So, how'd it go with Kevin?"
07x10,Robin,"Well, I was just about to tell him..."
07x10,Unknown,Flashback starts
07x10,Robin,"Okay, Kevin..."
07x10,Sandy,"Erika, I've been meaning to speak with you all night."
07x10,Erika,Really? What about?
07x10,Sandy,"About me bending your hard little body over the railing of this boat and copulating furiously while I admire the New York City skyline. Or, if you're feeling dirty, we can always face Jersey. Thoughts?"
07x10,Kevin,(screams) Jalapeño! And just a hint of coconut. (screams)
07x10,Unknown,Flashback ends
07x10,Robin,"Kevin hit his head, he might have a concussion. So obviously I couldn't tell him. What about you?"
07x10,Barney,Something even worse happened to her.
07x10,Nora,I got a tiny spot of wine on my sleeve.
07x10,Barney,I couldn't pile on. I'm not a monster.
07x10,Unknown,Back to Ted and Marshall who are still looking for the nachos for Lily.
07x10,Marshall,Where are they?
07x10,Ted,"Come on, forget the nachos. Everyone here is having fun. Look, even these guys. Check it out. Wow, music really does bring people together."
07x10,Marshall,Ted? Ted! Creepy guitar guy is following us.
07x10,Unknown,(ominous music plays)
07x10,Unknown,(both screaming)
07x10,Unknown,(panting)
07x10,Ted,"We did a whole nother lap. Oh, man, we missed like, half the concert now. Come on, let's just go back to our seats."
07x10,Marshall,"Ted, Ted, Ted. The nacho line was right here all along."
07x10,Unknown,(both laughing)
07x10,Ted,So stupid.
07x10,Unknown,Back to Robin and Barney on the boat.
07x10,Robin,"As soon as we dock, I'm taking Kevin to the E.R. God, I wish last night never happened."
07x10,Unknown,(sighs)
07x10,Barney,I don't.
07x10,Robin,What do you mean?
07x10,Barney,"What if this whole thing, it isn't the story of how we both made a horrible mistake and ruined our relationships. What if it's actually the story of how we got back together?"
07x10,Robin,"Okay, I'm gonna ask you one last time. Is this what you want?"
07x10,Barney,It's what we both want! Why else are we rushing to tell them what we did? On a boat! That is a terrible idea!
07x10,Robin,"Barney, we tried this and we failed. Why try again?"
07x10,Barney,"Because I haven't stopped thinking about you, and you haven't stopped thinking about me."
07x10,Robin,I’m such a mess. Why... Why do you even like me?
07x10,Barney,I guess... 'cause you're almost as messed up as I am.
07x10,Robin,"Well, there's the small issue that we're currently dating other people."
07x10,Barney,"How about this? After we dock, let's each do what we have to do, and then meet up at MacLaren's at midnight and... talk about us."
07x10,Sandy,Don't forget your mystery gift bags! They're condoms.
07x10,Unknown,Back to Ted and Marshall.
07x10,Ted,We just went all the way around again!
07x10,Marshall,Where the hell are these nachos?!
07x10,Ted,Who cares about nachos?
07x10,Guy,"I do. I love nachos, man!"
07x10,Ted,"You gotta relax, man. You keep worrying about stuff like nachos, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack. I'm going back in."
07x10,Marshall,Fine! Ha! Joke's on you! The nacho line was right here all along! (He gets back in line for the ladies’ room AGAIN)
07x10,Older Ted,"Robin and Barney were finally off the boat, so they both assumed it was going to be a lot easier to admit what they had done."
07x10,Unknown,Robin and Kevin are at the hospital.
07x10,Robin,Kevin...
07x10,Kevin,"Me first. Look, I don't want to make too much out of saying ""I love you"" for the first time."
07x10,Robin,Any way I can jump in with my thing?
07x10,Kevin,Robin... I love you.
07x10,Unknown,Barney and Nora are just entering the apartment.
07x10,Barney,"Okay, Nora, look..."
07x10,Unknown,(gasps)
07x10,Nora,"Mom! Dad! Hi, Nora, we got in early!"
07x10,Barney and Robin (at the same time),Should've done it on the boat.
07x10,Unknown,Back to Ted and Marshall.
07x10,Ted,Ah!
07x10,Creepy guitar guy,"Hey, where's your friend?"
07x10,Ted,"We missed almost the entire show because he put his stupid quest for nachos ahead of our friendship, so I bolted."
07x10,Creepy guitar guy,"Well, I'm just a creepy old guitar player, but isn't any time spent with a friend a blessing? And if nachos is all you seek... take mine, brother."
07x10,Ted,Wow! Thank you.
07x10,Guy,"It's a sign, bro."
07x10,Ted,Yes.  It's a sign I should go find Marshall! (laughs) Marshall! Marshall!
07x10,Nora’s dad,"So, Barney, Nora's told us so much about you, but we want to know everything."
07x10,Barney,"Uh, let's see. Suits, laser tag. I say ""wait for it"" a lot. That's about it. You two must be exhausted."
07x10,Nora’s mom,I'll make coffee.
07x10,Nora’s dad,"I'm so glad to see how happy you both are. When you meet the right person, you know it. You can't stop thinking about them. They're your best friend... and your soul mate. You can't wait to spend the rest of your life with them. No one and nothing else can compare. Now, where the hell is that coffee, eh? (chuckles)"
07x10,Barney,"Look, Nora, there's something I have to tell you."
07x10,Unknown,(ominous music plays)
07x10,Unknown,(groans)
07x10,Unknown,Creepy guitar guy clasps his chests and collapses.
07x10,Marshall,"Heart attack. Oh, God, Ted was right. I have to relax! Ted!"
07x10,Ted,Marshall!
07x10,Marshall,Ted?
07x10,Marshall,Ted!
07x10,Ted,Marshall!
07x10,Marshall,"Oh, Ted! Oh, Ted! I'm so sorry! You were right."
07x10,Ted,"No, Marshall, you... Yeah, I was right. But look, nachos!"
07x10,Marshall,Come on. Let's go back inside.
07x10,Unknown,(audience cheering)
07x10,Marshall,That's it. It's over.
07x10,Ted,We missed the whole show.
07x10,Unknown,Back to the hospital.
07x10,Kevin,"So... yup, I love you."
07x10,Robin,"Look, Kevin... there's something I have to tell you."
07x10,Unknown,At Nora’s apartment.
07x10,Barney,I cheated on you.
07x10,Nora,I don't even know how to react.
07x10,Barney,"I am so sorry. I know I don't get any second chances, but you will always be..."
07x10,Nora,Was this a one-time thing? Can you tell me it didn't mean anything?
07x10,Barney,No.
07x10,Unknown,(Nora leaves)
07x10,Unknown,Back at the palooza.
07x10,Marshall,"I'm sorry, Ted. I still want to have fun. I have to be a good husband and father too. There's just not enough time, you know?"
07x10,Ted,I know. It's all going by so damn fast.
07x10,Marshall,We’re getting old.
07x10,Unknown,(Lily appears)
07x10,Marshall,"Lily! Hey! Oh, Lily, I'm so sorry that we ruined our night."
07x10,Ted,Yeah.
07x10,Lily,What are you guys talking about? You've been gone less than two minutes.
07x10,Older Ted,"Kids, she was right."
07x10,Unknown,(Camera footage shows what really happened.)
07x10,Ted,My hand.
07x10,Marshall,Whoa!
07x10,Ted,Ah! concert!
07x10,Marshall,Nachos! Ah!
07x10,Unknown,(laughs)
07x10,Ted,Music!
07x10,Unknown,(both scream)
07x10,Ted,Time!
07x10,Marshall,Nachos!
07x10,Ted,Thank you!
07x10,Guy,"It's a sign, bro."
07x10,Marshall,"Oh, oh... Heart attack!"
07x10,Ted,Marshall! Marshall!
07x10,Marshall,Ted!! Ted!!
07x10,Unknown,(They hug and gasp loudly.)
07x10,Both,Time...
07x10,Marshall,Lily!
07x10,Unknown,Flashback ends
07x10,Ted,"Marshall, do you get what this means? Life isn't moving too fast. We-we still have time for everything."
07x10,Marshall,And we're not gonna miss the concert!
07x10,Unknown,Back in the audience.
07x10,Marshall,I'm freaking out right now.
07x10,Ted,We gotta get out of here.
07x10,Marshall,Yeah.
07x10,Lily,Do you guys know where the ladies' room is?
07x10,Ted,No idea.
07x10,Marshall,Haven't seen it.
07x10,Unknown,"Ted, Marshall and Lily enter MacLaren’s and find Barney at the bar."
07x10,All,Hey! How's it going?
07x10,Barney,"Oh, not great. Nora and I broke up."
07x10,Lily,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
07x10,Barney,"I don't really feel like getting into it, but... I think the worst part is over."
07x10,Unknown,"Robin enters the bar, and Kevin follows her shortly."
07x10,Robin,Hey.
07x10,All,"Hey. Hey, Kev. What's up, Kev?"
07x10,Kevin,"How's it going, buddy?"
07x10,Robin,"Hey, guys."
07x10,Unknown,Flashback. Hospital scene.
07x10,Robin,There's something I have to tell you.
07x10,Kevin,Then don't.
07x10,Robin,What?
07x10,Kevin,"If there's one thing I've learned as a therapist, it's that just because something needs to be told doesn't always mean it needs to be heard."
07x10,Robin,"Kevin, I did something bad."
07x10,Kevin,"We've all done bad things. Doesn't mean we're bad people. Look, I don't care about every detail from your past, and I hope you don't care about mine either. What I do care about is you, and that from tonight forward, you're in this as much as I am. What do you think?"
07x10,Robin,I'm such a mess. Why do you even like me?
07x10,Kevin,"Come here. I am constantly amazed by the things you say, entranced by the things you do, and unlike a certain Jalapeño Coconut Vodka martini, you're easy on the eyes. And if we're together long enough, I hope that one day you see yourself the way I see you."
07x10,Robin,That's a pretty good answer.
07x10,Older Ted,"Sometimes hours can feel like minutes and sometimes a single second can last a lifetime. For Barney, the second that would never end was this one."
07x10,Unknown,(ticking)
07x10,Unknown,(ticking stops)
07x10,Barney,"Well, um, I should go. Tough night."
07x10,Robin,I'm so sorry.
07x10,Barney,Don't be. It's nothing.
07x10,Ted,"It feels good to be sober again. Man, how long have we been sitting here, right?"
07x10,Kevin,12 seconds and you're in the wrong booth.
07x10,Ted,I should go to bed.
07x11,Unknown,Narrator
07x11,"In the fall of 2011, Lily and Marshall received a surprising gift from Lily's grandparents",their house in Long Island.
07x11,Unknown,Lily and Marshall decided to sell it for one simple reason.
07x11,Unknown,It's Long Island.
07x11,Unknown,I don't want to spend my Saturday in Long Island.
07x11,Unknown,"I know, babe, but the realtor staged the place with fake furniture and she wants us to check it out before the open house."
07x11,Unknown,All right.
07x11,Unknown,Can we at least do it on the fake bed?
07x11,Unknown,I'm embarrassed that you have to ask.
07x11,Unknown,"So, they headed out to Long Island, and when they walked in the door..."
07x11,Unknown,We'll take it!
07x11,Unknown,We-We can't take it.
07x11,Unknown,We're the ones selling it.
07x11,Unknown,"We are selling it, right?"
07x11,Unknown,"Baby, your grandparents gave you this house outright."
07x11,Unknown,"So, the way I see it, we have five options."
07x11,One,sell it.
07x11,Two,year-round haunted house.
07x11,Three,"giant fence around the perimeter, chimp sanctuary."
07x11,Unknown,There's already a tire swing in the backyard.
07x11,Four,we destroy it with sledgehammers.
07x11,Unknown,I like four.
07x11,Or five,"we move in, raise our children and make this our family home."
07x11,Unknown,Till they graduate.
07x11,Unknown,Then we destroy it with sledgehammers.
07x11,(voice breaks),As a family.
07x11,Unknown,"No, this is crazy!"
07x11,Unknown,We are New York people.
07x11,Unknown,"We have a big, beautiful apartment that we love."
07x11,Unknown,You're right.
07x11,Unknown,But something happened
07x11,Unknown,to Lily and Marshall that day.
07x11,Unknown,Something that happens to all New Yorkers who return home from anywhere other than New York.
07x11,Unknown,"Their big, lovely apartment..."
07x11,Unknown,Huh. That's weird.
07x11,Unknown,"Okay, after Thanksgiving, I'm cutting out carbs."

07x11,Unknown,Narrator
07x11,,"Now, kids, it had been a rough couple weeks for Barney."
07x11,Unknown,"First, he cheated on his girlfriend with Robin, then he broke up with his girlfriend for Robin, then Robin chose Kevin over him."
07x11,Unknown,So he was kind of in a bad place.
07x11,Unknown,Ted
07x11,,Hey.
07x11,Unknown,You all right?
07x11,Unknown,Why wouldn't I be all right?
07x11,Unknown,Barney's single again!
07x11,Unknown,It's what America's been clamoring for.
07x11,Unknown,You just went through a break-up.
07x11,Unknown,That's usually when people do something crazy.
07x11,Unknown,"If you were a girl, you'd have cut bangs and be dating you by now."
07x11,Unknown,Just promise me you won't do something crazy.
07x11,Unknown,I promise I won't do something crazy.
07x11,Unknown,"Don't worry, he's gonna do something crazy."
07x11,Unknown,"In fact, I think I'm done with girls."
07x11,Unknown,I'm not sure I even like them anymore.
07x11,Unknown,"Based on all the stuff you've done to them over the years, I'm not sure you ever liked them."
07x11,Unknown,I'm serious.
07x11,Unknown,"Come on, you love girls."
07x11,Unknown,"If anyone should be done with girls, it's me."
07x11,Unknown,Look at the year I've had.
07x11,Unknown,"Zoey, Victoria, the Slutty Pumpkin."
07x11,Unknown,Now I'm worried you're gonna do something crazy.
07x11,Unknown,I'm not gonna do something crazy.
07x11,Unknown,"And yes, I'm gonna do something crazy, too."
07x11,Unknown,"But girls, man."
07x11,Unknown,Girls.
07x11,Unknown,You know what would kick ass?
07x11,Unknown,Being gay?
07x11,Unknown,Being gay would kick ass!
07x11,Unknown,Word. Guys understand each other.
07x11,Unknown,"Imagine a relationship where, instead of talking about feelings all the time, you just play some"
07x11,Unknown,"Madden,"
07x11,Unknown,"eat a pizza, give each other a happy, roll over and have some cuddle-free shut-eye."
07x11,Unknown,"Bro, for what it's worth, if we were both gay, you'd be my first call."
07x11,Unknown,Would you mind calling Marshall and telling him that? 'Cause he thinks...
07x11,Unknown,"No, this is only in a scenario where just you and I are gay, not Marshall."
07x11,Unknown,"But if all three of us were gay, you'd pick me over Marshall, right?"
07x11,Unknown,If all three of us were gay?
07x11,Unknown,"Girlfriend, we would all three of us have some fun."
07x11,Unknown,Damn right we would.
07x11,Unknown,We're not gay.
07x11,Unknown,Nope. Stuck with girls.
07x11,Unknown,(grunts)
07x11,Unknown,"I wish men could have children on their own, like sea horses."
07x11,Unknown,Are you saying what I think you're saying?
07x11,Unknown,They have a little pouch.
07x11,Unknown,They should be called sea kangaroos.
07x11,Unknown,"No, y-you want kids?"
07x11,Unknown,Maybe I've kind of lately been thinking about the whole wife and kids thing.
07x11,Unknown,Just minus the wife.
07x11,Unknown,You could always go it alone.
07x11,Unknown,Like Mr. Drummond on
07x11,Unknown,Diff'rent Strokes.
07x11,Unknown,"Yeah, but that was the '80s, when you could just swing by any inner-city playground in your limo and scoop up some kids."
07x11,Unknown,Mmm.
07x11,Unknown,Simpler times.
07x11,Unknown,Hmm.
07x11,Unknown,"I guess it's better to have someone in it with you anyway, you know? Lifetime partnership."
07x11,Unknown,The only partnership in my life that has stood the test of time is this one.
07x11,Unknown,The sacred bond of man and bro.
07x11,Unknown,Maybe we should start a family together.
07x11,Unknown,(both laugh)
07x11,Unknown,Are you kidding?
07x11,Unknown,This place is huge.
07x11,Unknown,"I mean, look, I can dance all crazy in here."
07x11,Unknown,Oh! Sh...
07x11,Unknown,"Listen, um, Robin, are you okay with us all doing Thanksgiving out in East Meadow?"
07x11,Unknown,"Uh, yeah, I guess that'd be nice."
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, great!"
07x11,Unknown,"And then after Thanksgiving, Lily and I were thinking that we would just stay at the house until, you know... we die."
07x11,Unknown,What?
07x11,Unknown,No!
07x11,Unknown,You can't move to Long Island!
07x11,Unknown,But this house is so nice.
07x11,Unknown,"It's big, and it's clean, and if there's cockroaches, they respect us enough to sneak around."
07x11,Unknown,Listen to yourself.
07x11,Unknown,This is Pregnancy Brain all over again.
07x11,Unknown,"No, I'm done with Pregnancy Brain."
07x11,Unknown,I've moved on to weird pregnancy sex dreams.
07x11,Unknown,Officer.
07x11,Unknown,You know. You know.
07x11,Unknown,"I'm-I'm just saying, you're not in the right mind to be making this decision right now."
07x11,Unknown,You know what? Robin's right.
07x11,Unknown,We are in no state of mind to make this kind of decision.
07x11,Unknown,Thank you. And now you're stepping off the crazy bus.
07x11,Unknown,We let the universe decide.
07x11,Unknown,And now you're back on board.
07x11,Unknown,"You hear that, Universe?"
07x11,Unknown,If you send us a sign in the next...
07x11,Unknown,"24 hours, then we're moving to Long Island!"
07x11,Unknown,Okay?
07x11,Unknown,Go.
07x11,Unknown,Robin
07x11,,"Hey, guys, for the last time, this place is enormous--"
07x11,Unknown,Oh!
07x11,Unknown,"Geez, how many lamps do you have?"
07x11,Unknown,It's genius!
07x11,Unknown,"Instead of throwing away your life marrying some girl, you just go splitsies on a kid with your best bro!"
07x11,Unknown,I wouldn't have to choose between dating and having a family.
07x11,Unknown,"Hell, I could bring the kids on dates!"
07x11,Unknown,And a broken home?
07x11,Unknown,"Um, what's that?"
07x11,Unknown,"Our kids will never know, 'cause we're never gonna split up!"
07x11,Unknown,Why would we?
07x11,Unknown,"I mean, sure, when your wife walks in on you banging a hot flight attendant, you get a divorce."
07x11,Unknown,But when your bro-parent walks in on you banging a hot flight attendant...
07x11,Unknown,"You get five of these bad boys, right up high!"
07x11,Unknown,"(laughs) And you totally join in, right?!"
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, no, there's the line. That's the line."
07x11,Unknown,We found the line. It's good we know where it is.
07x11,Unknown,"Hey, guys."
07x11,Unknown,Hey!
07x11,Unknown,Hey.
07x11,Unknown,We have an announcement.
07x11,Unknown,"So what you're saying is, if you're meant to move to Long Island, some sign from the universe will magically appear at your doorstep?"
07x11,Unknown,"Now, kids, I don't think there was a knock on the door at that exact moment, but for the purposes of this story..."
07x11,Unknown,(knock on door)
07x11,Unknown,"Hi, I'm Clive."
07x11,Unknown,I live upstairs from you.
07x11,Unknown,Is this your sign?
07x11,Unknown,"I don't know, Clive."
07x11,Unknown,Is it?
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, did we leave that outside?"
07x11,Unknown,"Yeah, we're selling our house in Long Island."
07x11,Unknown,Oh. Too bad you're not selling this place.
07x11,Unknown,I'd love to turn mine into a duplex.
07x11,Unknown,"And I'd give you a really good price for it, because I am so rich."
07x11,Unknown,He did not say that.
07x11,Unknown,His shoes did.
07x11,Unknown,"Okay, the point is, we got the sign."
07x11,Unknown,We're moving to East Meadow.
07x11,Unknown,Let's get some champagne.
07x11,Unknown,"And just like that, Lily and Marshall were beginning a new chapter in their lives."
07x11,Unknown,Which meant only one thing for us...
07x11,Unknown,We're having a baby!
07x11,Unknown,Bro-parents activate!
07x11,Unknown,(makes expl*si*n noise)
07x11,Unknown,"Hey, let's talk baby names!"
07x11,Unknown,Barney...
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, my God! That was my first choice, too."
07x11,Unknown,"No, listen. You and I are drunk."
07x11,Unknown,Which means there's a chance that adopting a baby--
07x11,Unknown,"no matter how cute he is in my head with his little cowboy outfit on and he's riding our dog like a horse and we also have a dog, purebred Golden, but it's okay, she's a rescue--"
07x11,Unknown,might not be a good idea.
07x11,Unknown,You're right.
07x11,Unknown,"So let's go home, take some aspirin, drink lots of water, and then see if it's still a good idea tomorrow."
07x11,Unknown,It's still a good idea!
07x11,Unknown,It's totally still a good idea!
07x11,Unknown,We're having a baby!
07x11,Unknown,(both sobbing)
07x11,Unknown,Narrator
07x11,"Kids, I cannot stress this enough",Barney and I were going through a tough time.
07x11,Unknown,"You're not leaving, and that's final."
07x11,Unknown,Look what I bought at
07x11,4,00 a.m. in New York City.
07x11,Unknown,"A bootleg VHS of a very, very popular Korean movie, this genuine Lenny Vintone purse and the number of a man who can get me a kidney."
07x11,Unknown,Do that on Long Island.
07x11,Unknown,"Look, Robin, we appreciate that you want us to stay in the city, but this is what we want."
07x11,Unknown,"I mean, you understand, right?"
07x11,Unknown,(sighs)
07x11,Unknown,No.
07x11,Unknown,Here are a few fun facts about Long Island.
07x11,Unknown,(clears throat)
07x11,Number one,it's Brooklyn's fart trail.
07x11,Unknown,So Barney and I--
07x11,Unknown,"and again, going through a tough time, can't stress that enough--"
07x11,Unknown,found an adoption agency Web site and filled out their online application.
07x11,Name,Barney Stinson.
07x11,Unknown,Ted Mosby.
07x11,Unknown,Address...
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, put my address in Westchester."
07x11,Unknown,They'll want to see we'll be raising this child in a good environment.
07x11,Unknown,"You know, the suburbs."
07x11,Unknown,What? No.
07x11,Unknown,All my guys are here.
07x11,Unknown,Your guys?
07x11,Unknown,Yeah. You know how I got a guy for everything?
07x11,Unknown,"Well, they're all in New York."
07x11,Unknown,"My suit guy, my shoe guy, my ticket guy, my club guy."
07x11,Unknown,"And if I don't have a guy for something, then I have a guy guy to get me a guy."
07x11,Unknown,"And oddly enough, his name is Guy."
07x11,Unknown,"Okay, fine. How about this?"
07x11,Unknown,"We stay in the city during the week, then on the weekend, country house in the burbs!"
07x11,Unknown,This is why bro-parenting works!
07x11,Unknown,Totally!
07x11,Unknown,"And with your salary plus my salary, we can totally afford two places."
07x11,Unknown,Oh.
07x11,Unknown,What?
07x11,Unknown,"So... uh, you're gonna keep your job?"
07x11,Unknown,"Robin, this discussion is closed."
07x11,Unknown,"The universe told us to do it, so we're doing it."
07x11,Unknown,"Well, the universe gets it wrong sometimes."
07x11,Unknown,Remember when Marshall was trying to decide between becoming an environmental lawyer and working at a bank?
07x11,Unknown,That's a funny story.
07x11,Unknown,"Marshall was fed up with his job at GNB and was thinking about leaving it all behind, so he and Lily agreed he should wait for a sign from the universe to tell him what to do."
07x11,Unknown,Then one day...
07x11,Unknown,Of course.
07x11,Unknown,It's so clear.
07x11,Unknown,It's been right there all along.
07x11,Unknown,I have to call Lily.
07x11,Unknown,"Excuse me. Excuse me, sir."
07x11,Unknown,"I'm sorry, but, um, can I please borrow your..."
07x11,Unknown,Ernie Hudson?
07x11,Unknown,Yes.
07x11,Unknown,Can I borrow your phone?
07x11,Unknown,Who you gonna call?
07x11,Unknown,And did Marshall become a Ghostbuster?
07x11,Unknown,That firehouse is still for sale.
07x11,Unknown,Even Ernie Hudson begged you not to go through with that.
07x11,Unknown,Ernie Hudson is a coward!
07x11,Unknown,(gasps) Oh!
07x11,Unknown,(gasps)
07x11,Unknown,Of course I'm gonna keep my job.
07x11,Unknown,Why wouldn't I keep my job?
07x11,Unknown,"Well, I mean, this whole architecture thing... isn't it more of a hobby?"
07x11,Unknown,Excuse me?
07x11,Unknown,And now we're fighting. You know what?
07x11,Unknown,Forget I said anything.
07x11,Unknown,"No! No, no, no. We're having this discussion."
07x11,Unknown,Architecture is my life's work.
07x11,Unknown,Why don't you quit
07x11,Unknown,your
07x11,Unknown,"job? I don't even know what it is you do for a living. ""What it is I do for a living?"""
07x11,Unknown,"I work, Ted, 14 hours a day so that our baby can have food and clothes and a nice house, while you sit around doodling pictures of buildings."
07x11,Unknown,"That's ""what it is I do."""
07x11,Unknown,You know what? Screw this. I'm gonna go to the bar.
07x11,Unknown,"Yeah, right, right, 'cause the answer's always at the bottom of a bottle!"
07x11,Unknown,"Wait, wait, wait! Hold it!"
07x11,Unknown,Brainstorm. Brainstorm.
07x11,Unknown,Nobody quits their job.
07x11,Unknown,We get a nanny.
07x11,Unknown,Dibs on the nanny.
07x11,Unknown,No. No banging the nanny.
07x11,Unknown,"Ted, please don not dig in on this whole no-banging-the-nanny policy."
07x11,Unknown,"Okay, fine. We'll get two nannies."
07x11,Unknown,"One for banging, one for childcare."
07x11,Unknown,Slash banging. Dibs on both nannies!
07x11,Unknown,"Just think of it, Ted, you and me, living together, with our kid, my two hot nannies, our pet cobra..."
07x11,Unknown,What?
07x11,Unknown,"A kid needs a pet cobra, Ted. Don't be a pill about this."
07x11,Unknown,"And we'll have amazing weeklong parties, and there'll be swords and ninja stars lying around."
07x11,Unknown,Narrator
07x11,Unknown,adopting a baby with a friend?
07x11,Unknown,Crazy.
07x11,Unknown,Adopting a baby with Barney? Freaking nuts.
07x11,Unknown,"I can't adopt a baby with you, Barney."
07x11,Unknown,Why not?
07x11,Unknown,Because we don't even have one yet and you're already a terrible father.
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, I get it."
07x11,Unknown,You want one of the nannies.
07x11,Unknown,"Well, you can't have 'em! They're mine!"
07x11,Unknown,So you're just gonna have to get yourself a third nanny.
07x11,Unknown,Except dibs on the third nanny! Good day!
07x11,Unknown,Narrator
07x11,Unknown,Which brings us to Thanksgiving.
07x11,Unknown,"Marshall, Lily and Robin were heading out to Long Island early to get ready."
07x11,Unknown,(grunting)
07x11,Unknown,"Okay, how is this even possible?! 'Cause how did we even get it in here?!"
07x11,Unknown,(grunts)
07x11,Unknown,"Okay, I change my mind. I want an epidural."
07x11,Unknown,You guys are crazy.
07x11,Unknown,This place is enormous.
07x11,Unknown,"I mean, look arou..."
07x11,Unknown,Have you never heard of overhead lighting?!
07x11,Unknown,(sighs)
07x11,Unknown,You're right.
07x11,Unknown,I get it.
07x11,Unknown,This place is great.
07x11,Unknown,"Um, excuse me. Where is the restroom?"
07x11,Unknown,"Oh. Right there. Oh, good, great."
07x11,Unknown,I'm just gonna go in there and... not come out until you promise never to move away!
07x11,Unknown,It's a good thing we have three bathrooms.
07x11,Unknown,"Hey, Barney."
07x11,Unknown,"Uh, listen, sorry about the other day when I said you'd be a terrible father."
07x11,Unknown,You had no reason to think otherwise.
07x11,Unknown,Totally understandable. I'm not mad.
07x11,Unknown,(knocking)
07x11,Unknown,Thanks.
07x11,Unknown,"And, uh, let's be honest, we were both acting a little crazy."
07x11,Unknown,I don't think either of us is truly ready for the responsibility of...
07x11,Unknown,Daddy's home.
07x11,Unknown,"Uh, Barney, uh, where did you get this baby?"
07x11,Unknown,Please.
07x11,Unknown,Did you adopt it?
07x11,Unknown,Please.
07x11,Unknown,Do you have a baby guy?
07x11,Unknown,Did Guy the guy guy get you a baby guy?
07x11,Unknown,"Ted, we should get going."
07x11,Unknown,"No, no, no. I'm not going anywhere with you."
07x11,Unknown,"For all I know, I could be aiding and abetting a kidnapping."
07x11,Unknown,Shh. Bro-daddy's not mad.
07x11,Unknown,"He's just being a wittle loud. He wuvs you! Yes, he does!"
07x11,Unknown,This is insane!
07x11,Unknown,You'll feel better outside.
07x11,Unknown,Come on.
07x11,Unknown,"No, I can't."
07x11,Unknown,Yeah. Na-na-na.
07x11,Unknown,Narrator
07x11,Unknown,But then we went outside.
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, my goodness."
07x11,Unknown,What a beautiful baby.
07x11,Unknown,Thank you.
07x11,Unknown,"By the way, my friend and I, we're not a couple."
07x11,Unknown,We are two straight guys who are single and we have a baby. Just so you know.
07x11,Unknown,Look at this sweet girl.
07x11,Unknown,"Hi. I was just telling this first girl, my friend and I, both straight, both available, and we have a baby."
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, who is this little angel?"
07x11,"Okay, real quick","me and him, not gay, single, have a baby."
07x11,Unknown,We should look into having a sign made.
07x11,Unknown,"Kids, again, we were going through a difficult time."
07x11,Unknown,But this part was kind of fun.
07x11,Unknown,Women
07x11,,Aw...! So cute!
07x11,Unknown,This is awesome.
07x11,Unknown,Right?
07x11,Unknown,"Robin, come out and talk to us."
07x11,Unknown,I'm not coming out of this bathroom until everyone stops acting crazy!
07x11,Unknown,No one is being crazy.
07x11,Unknown,"Again, for the purposes of this story..."
07x11,Unknown,Ted and I have a baby. Crazy!
07x11,Unknown,What the hell is that?
07x11,Unknown,"Guys, this is Hurricane Stinson-Mosby."
07x11,Unknown,Mosby-Stinson.
07x11,Unknown,You named your baby Hurricane?
07x11,Unknown,That is... ultimately inconsiderate to the child who has to live with that name.
07x11,Unknown,"Okay, how the hell does Barney have a baby?"
07x11,Unknown,No idea. Super confused.
07x11,Unknown,I'm finding it best to just sort of go with it.
07x11,Unknown,"She's super cute, though, right?"
07x11,Unknown,Wait a minute.
07x11,Unknown,(sniffs)
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, guh! Hurricane dookied in her drawers."
07x11,Unknown,Ha-ha! Poopy pants!
07x11,Unknown,She needs a new diaper.
07x11,Unknown,Right. Where do you keep your diapers?
07x11,Unknown,We don't have any.
07x11,Unknown,You don't... Wow.
07x11,Unknown,Okay. (scoffs) I guess I'll go buy some.
07x11,Unknown,You're gonna be a mom and you don't have any diapers?
07x11,Unknown,"Lord, watch over that child."
07x11,Unknown,"Uh, okay."
07x11,Unknown,"Come here, you."
07x11,Unknown,"So, there was talk of a cheese plate?"
07x11,Unknown,(knocking)

07x11,Unknown,Hey.
07x11,Unknown,Cheese?
07x11,Unknown,Thanks.
07x11,Unknown,If you don't mind me asking... what-what is this all about?
07x11,Unknown,"I mean, you are one of the most strong, independent, non-locking-themselves-in-"
07x11,Unknown,a-bathroom-on-Thanksgiving people I know.
07x11,Unknown,Why-why are you so upset about us moving?
07x11,Unknown,Maybe I just need you guys more than you think.
07x11,Unknown,Is this about more than us moving?
07x11,Unknown,This is good cheese.
07x11,Unknown,Robin?
07x11,Unknown,Yeah?
07x11,Unknown,Do you think I should've become a Ghostbuster?
07x11,Unknown,"I think you made the right call, buddy."
07x11,Unknown,"Okay, Ted, I'm not gonna ask you where Barney got this baby."
07x11,Unknown,But do you have any idea why?
07x11,Unknown,"Well, a few nights ago, we were talking... you know, ""We hate girls, we wish we were gay,"" just guy stuff."
07x11,Unknown,And we kind of sort of decided to... adopt a baby.
07x11,Unknown,"Yeah, that's crazy."
07x11,Unknown,I know.
07x11,Unknown,"Is it, though?"
07x11,Unknown,Yes.
07x11,Unknown,I know.
07x11,Unknown,"But is it, though?"
07x11,Unknown,Yes.
07x11,Unknown,"Well, so what if it's crazy?"
07x11,Unknown,"I've been ready to meet someone to start a family with for a long time now, and I keep not meeting her."
07x11,Unknown,"Barney is one of my best friends in the world, we rarely fight, and once we iron out the whole pet cobra thing, we will be amazing dads."
07x11,Unknown,Why shouldn't we try this?
07x11,Unknown,When's the last time you fed her?
07x11,Unknown,She had some root beer on the train.
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, Ted. And I'm sorry, but you cannot call a baby Hurricane."
07x11,Unknown,"Actually, her name is Sadie."
07x11,Unknown,"James, what are you doing here?"
07x11,Unknown,Did Barney not tell you that we were coming for Thanksgiving?
07x11,Unknown,"Uh, no."
07x11,Unknown,Then he probably also did not tell you that he was babysitting our new daughter.
07x11,Unknown,This is your daughter?
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, thank God."
07x11,Unknown,And congratulations.
07x11,Unknown,Thanks. Come here.
07x11,Unknown,Aw... Aw...
07x11,Unknown,"I guess this is good-bye, Hurri... Sadie."
07x11,(whispers),Your name is Hurricane. Don't ever forget it.
07x11,Unknown,Go with him. Go on.
07x11,Unknown,Come here. That a girl.
07x11,Unknown,"Hey, Ted, I overheard your little speech."
07x11,Unknown,It's not crazy.
07x11,Unknown,"About ten years ago, my best friend and I nearly did the same thing."
07x11,Unknown,"She was single, I was single, we both wanted a family."
07x11,Unknown,It made sense.
07x11,Unknown,But now?
07x11,Unknown,"Every day, we thank our lucky stars that we didn't do it. 'Cause what she found with her husband and what I found with mine--"
07x11,Unknown,it was worth the wait.
07x11,Unknown,Hurricane's a cool name.
07x11,Unknown,"Isn't it, Tom?"
07x11,Unknown,"The pet store was closer, so I just got her some wee-wee pads."
07x11,Unknown,"Oh, I also got this."
07x11,Unknown,It's beef-flavored and it's good for her teeth.
07x11,Unknown,James! Tom! Hey!
07x11,Unknown,Lily... did you get the e-mail that I sent you about inviting James and Tom to Thanksgiving?
07x11,Unknown,"I sent it to your CompuServe. That's your main one, right?"
07x11,Unknown,"Happy Thanksgiving, bro."
07x11,Unknown,Thanks. Hi.
07x11,Unknown,Hey!
07x11,Unknown,Let's go sit down.
07x11,Unknown,Hi.
07x11,Unknown,"All right, you got me."
07x11,Unknown,James is my baby guy.
07x11,Unknown,But these past three hours--
07x11,Unknown,"magical, right?"
07x11,Unknown,We can do this! Say we can do this.
07x11,Unknown,We can't do this.
07x11,Unknown,"Sorry, dude."
07x11,Unknown,We got to wait for the real thing... no matter how tough it gets.
07x11,Unknown,It gets pretty tough.
07x11,Unknown,"I know it does, buddy."
07x11,Unknown,"I have some time before dinner, right?"
07x11,Unknown,I'm going to go... I'm gonna take a little walk.
07x11,Unknown,All right. All right.

07x11,Unknown,Good. 'Cause get this.
07x11,Unknown,Ted almost adopted a baby.
07x11,Unknown,"Crazy, right?"
07x11,Unknown,(scoffs)
07x11,Unknown,Poor guy's going through some stuff.
07x11,Unknown,He actually tried to rope me into it.

07x12,Unknown,"Well, I'll just skip ahead to the moment I told him I was pregnant."
07x12,Unknown,W... What happened?
07x12,Unknown,Did I pass out?
07x12,Unknown,Not exactly.
07x12,Unknown,I'm pregnant.
07x12,Unknown,Are you sure you're not just getting fat?
07x12,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."

07x12,Unknown,"Well, no, not positive."
07x12,Unknown,I'm a week late.
07x12,Unknown,But I'm never late; it's a point of pride with me.
07x12,Unknown,I'm going to go see the doctor on Monday to find out for sure.
07x12,Unknown,"Until then, not a word of this to anyone."
07x12,Unknown,Not even Kevin?
07x12,Unknown,"I mean, it's probably his."
07x12,Unknown,I've spent years training my boys to swim the other way.
07x12,Unknown,Kevin and I haven't had sex yet.
07x12,Unknown,"If I'm pregnant, you're the dad."

07x12,Unknown,What is going on?
07x12,Unknown,"Hey, Mr. E. Scott... if you do not let me down, I am going to scream my head off until someone comes to help me, and then you're going to have to explain all of this to the cops."
07x12,Unknown,And then you'll have to explain why there's a picture of my ding-dong on your phone.
07x12,Unknown,There is no picture of your...
07x12,Unknown,There is now.

07x12,Unknown,"Yeah, yeah, um, I guess this, um, this pole-vaulting thing is finally hitting me."
07x12,Unknown,"I don't get it, Robin."
07x12,Unknown,Did you really want to be a pole-vaulter?
07x12,Unknown,"No, no, I was, uh, I was always adamantly against having a... uh, a pole-vaulting career, even though it's what most women want."
07x12,Unknown,Most women want to be a pole-vaulter?
07x12,Unknown,In Canada--
07x12,Unknown,it's very big up there.
07x12,Unknown,"You know, it's, it's meet a nice guy, get married, vault some poles, but I... never wanted that."
07x12,Unknown,"Of course, it's one thing not to want something."
07x12,Unknown,It's another to be told you can't have it.
07x12,Unknown,"I guess it's, it's just nice knowing that you could someday do it if you changed your mind."
07x12,Unknown,"But now, all of a sudden, that door is closed."
07x12,Unknown,What about the one where you ski and sh**t at the same time?
07x12,Unknown,That seems like something you'd be good at.
07x12,Unknown,"Oh, my God, Robin, look at this."
07x12,Unknown,O Cana-dorable!
07x12,Unknown,Am I right?
07x12,Unknown,Excuse me.
07x12,Unknown,"Yep, this works."
07x12,Unknown,"Scott, when I get down from here, you are going to be in big, big trouble, mister."
07x12,Unknown,"Come on, Mr. E."
07x12,Unknown,Didn't you ever cut loose when you were a kid?
07x12,Unknown,That's irrelevant.
07x12,Unknown,"I mean, of course I did."
07x12,Unknown,"One time, when my parents were out of town, my brothers and I set the basement on fire hosting an amateur wrestling exhibition."
07x12,Unknown,There were some theatrics.
07x12,Unknown,"See, you get me."
07x12,Unknown,I don't think of you as some dummy I trapped on the roof.

07x12,Unknown,Lily
07x12,,No way.
07x12,Unknown,"Kevin's an honest, decent guy who never on his best day could pull a hotter chick than Robin."
07x12,Unknown,Maybe Robin cheated on him.
07x12,Unknown,Maybe Robin is the dirty bird who slept with someone else.
07x12,Unknown,"I don't know, this pole-vaulting thing seems like a slam dunk to me."
07x12,Unknown,"Oh, it is so obvious."
07x12,Unknown,Barney.
07x12,Unknown,"What is the name of that guy you worked with-- uh, Randy?"
07x12,Unknown,It was Randy.

07x12,Unknown,She wants me to invite her to Ohio.
07x12,Unknown,That's got to be it!
07x12,Unknown,Either that or she slept with Barney.

07x12,Unknown,You're coming home with me for Christmas.
07x12,Unknown,"Yeah, nice try, dude."
07x12,Unknown,I wouldn't go to Cleveland for $125 million paid over six years.

07x12,Unknown,"Robin, what's wrong?"
07x12,Unknown,Nothing.
07x12,Unknown,Just tell me.
07x12,Unknown,Why do you need to know so bad?
07x12,Unknown,So I can cheer you up.
07x12,Unknown,It's not your job to cheer me up.
07x12,Unknown,"Yes, it is."
07x12,Unknown,Cheering you up is my job.

07x13,Unknown,I've always wanted to be a bartender.
07x13,Unknown,It's just like being a therapist.

07x13,Unknown,"Well, if it helps at all, I believe in you, too."
07x13,Unknown,Then there's a pretty good chance I don't exist.

07x14,Unknown,Yes! Finally!
07x14,Unknown,"By the way, did you see how she opened that bottle?"
07x14,Unknown,Whoa.
07x14,Unknown,Lights out in the suburbs is... is really dark.
07x14,Unknown,Marshall
07x14,,Where's the fuse box?
07x14,Unknown,Lily
07x14,,I don't know.
07x14,Unknown,(beep)
07x14,(singsongy),I know where it is.
07x14,Unknown,"Maybe I could fix it for you, if I wasn't so busy packing."
07x14,Unknown,Marshall
07x14,,You know what?
07x14,Unknown,I bet the fuse box is in the basement.
07x14,Unknown,I'll just... I'll go find it myself.
07x14,Unknown,How hard can it be?
07x14,Unknown,(Marshall groans)
07x14,Unknown,As hard as that desk you just walked into?
07x14,Unknown,(guffawing)
07x14,Unknown,"Good burn, Mickey."
07x14,Unknown,You deserve a little nightstand fudge for that one.
07x14,Unknown,Kevin
07x14,Unknown,Where do I look?
07x14,Unknown,"I mean, I can't look at her chest."
07x14,Unknown,Damn it! I just did.
07x14,Unknown,Maybe Robin didn't notice.
07x14,Unknown,"Man, he's really up in those jugs."
07x14,Unknown,"Shake it, baby!"
07x14,Unknown,A playa's gotta play!
07x14,Unknown,This is weird.
07x14,Unknown,I'll just look her in the eyes.
07x14,Unknown,Is he falling in love with this stripper?
07x14,Unknown,"Quick, do something cool."
07x14,Unknown,"Make it rain, son!"
07x14,Unknown,Money ain't no thang!
07x14,Unknown,"Damn it, there was a 20 in there."
07x14,Unknown,(chimes tinkling)
07x14,MICKEY (over intercom),"Hello, Mr. Eriksen."
07x14,Unknown,"From the sound of the wind chimes, I hear you've made it to the first floor."
07x14,Unknown,"Okay... you know what, Mickey?"
07x14,Unknown,You can save the creepy game master routine.
07x14,Unknown,It's only kind of terrifying me.
07x14,Unknown,"Oh, but the game has just begun."
07x14,Unknown,"I call it ""Try Not to Bang into All the Furniture and Stuff on Your Way to the Fuse Box in the Basement, Marshall."""
07x14,Unknown,That's just a working title.
07x14,Unknown,Hey!
07x14,Unknown,"Got a little boob glitter on your eyebrow, Mac Daddy."
07x14,Unknown,Straight pimpin'.
07x14,Unknown,"Barney, you got a little bit, too."
07x14,Unknown,Where?
07x14,Unknown,Did I get it?
07x14,Unknown,"Yeah, you got it."
07x14,Unknown,Who needs Marshall and Lily?
07x14,Unknown,"We got a new g*ng, and we're all going to hang out together forever."
07x14,Unknown,My shift is done.
07x14,Unknown,Good-bye.
07x14,Unknown,"Wait, stop!"
07x14,Unknown,"Technically, this song's not over, so we still own you."
07x14,Unknown,Plus we're best friends!
07x14,Unknown,Where to next?
07x14,Unknown,We go to underground poker game in mostly-abandoned insane asylum.
07x14,Unknown,Yes!
07x14,"This is gonna be awesome, and when it is, I want you all to remember who led you there","Barney Stinson, new group leader."
07x14,Unknown,(giggles)
07x14,Unknown,Yay!
07x14,Unknown,I'm winning all your chippies!
07x14,Unknown,Let's not drink when we're...
07x14,Unknown,I'm thirsty; it's good.
07x14,Unknown,It's good.
07x14,Unknown,(intercom beeps)
07x14,LILY (over intercom),"Marshall, I just remembered I saw a box of matches in the drawer by the trash can."
07x14,Unknown,"Okay, thanks, baby."
07x14,Unknown,"Lily, I can't find them."
07x14,Unknown,Looking for these?
07x14,Unknown,(evil chuckle over intercom)
07x14,Unknown,"Oh, right, you can't see me."
07x14,Unknown,"Um, well, I'm burning the matches you so desperately need."
07x14,Unknown,(evil laugh)
07x14,Unknown,"Aah, ooh, ow!"
07x14,(over intercom),Ow.
07x14,Unknown,Hah! Oh!
07x14,Unknown,(laughs)
07x14,Unknown,Mickey... guess who found the basement stairs?
07x14,Unknown,"I'll be down at that fuse box in no time, and when I get there, I'm sure that I'll figure out how fuse boxes work, so it'll be fine."
07x14,MICKEY (muffled),"Hey, Marshall, I know I've been messing with you, but seriously, that second step, don't..."
07x14,Unknown,"I don't want to hear it, Mickey."
07x14,Unknown,(yells)
07x14,Unknown,(yelling and crashing)
07x14,Unknown,"Oh, my knee!"
07x14,Unknown,(cymbals crash)
07x14,Unknown,Ow!
07x14,Unknown,(sighs)
07x14,Unknown,And watch out for my drum set.
07x14,Unknown,I win again!
07x14,Unknown,I was bluffing.
07x14,Unknown,I didn't even have enough cards.
07x14,Unknown,"Ted, please stop winning."
07x14,Unknown,"Hey, look, it's the New York City skyline."
07x14,Unknown,"♪ We built Chip City Uh, uh!"

07x14,Unknown,You know Butterfly-knife.
07x14,Unknown,"I'd expect this from Face Tattoo... or Jagged Cheek Scar, or Larry, but not you."
07x14,Unknown,Why don't I get nickname?
07x14,Unknown,"Because you have too many things, Larry."
07x14,Unknown,You get one thing!
07x14,Unknown,(squeals)
07x14,Unknown,(speaking Russian)
07x14,Unknown,"See, that's why you bring New Marshall."
07x14,Unknown,(high-pitched laugh)
07x14,Unknown,We go to party in slaughterhouse.
07x14,Unknown,You come?
07x14,Unknown,"Please, God, no."
07x14,Unknown,Don't let me be in charge of the g*ng anymore.
07x14,Unknown,I can't believe Dr. Kevin doesn't remember me from our sessions three years ago.
07x14,Unknown,Is that the lunatic that stabbed all those prison guards?
07x14,Unknown,We gotta hit that party!
07x14,Unknown,I'll never find love.
07x14,Unknown,We got to hit that party!
07x14,BOTH (weakly),Sweet.
07x14,Unknown,Lily?
07x14,Unknown,I think we made a mistake moving out to the suburbs.
07x14,Unknown,I miss our home.
07x14,Unknown,I miss our booth with our friends.
07x14,Unknown,(cymbal crashes)
07x14,Unknown,And I'm pretty sure I have a drumstick... somewhere bad.
07x14,Unknown,"Dad, why are you acting like this?"
07x14,Unknown,"Well, I was just trying to be helpful, but you guys want me out by the Fourth of July."
07x14,Unknown,Tomorrow.
07x14,Unknown,(sighs)
07x14,Unknown,"You know what a helpful father, not to mention grandfather, might do?"
07x14,Unknown,Get these lights back on.
07x14,Unknown,(sighs quietly)
07x14,Unknown,(intercom beeps)
07x14,Unknown,"Okay, Marshall, listen up."
07x14,Unknown,I'm gonna get you to that fuse box.
07x14,Unknown,"Can't you just come down here and do it for me, please?"
07x14,Unknown,I don't know anything about this house.
07x14,Unknown,"No, Marshall... you don't know anything about"
07x14,Unknown,your
07x14,Unknown,house.
07x14,Unknown,"All right, we got a lot of work to do."
07x14,Unknown,"Wait here, we get you on VPI list for party."
07x14,Unknown,"You give us, uh,"
07x14,Unknown,$200 per person.
07x14,Unknown,Cover charge.
07x14,Unknown,That's pretty steep for a cover charge.
07x14,Unknown,Is very good party.
07x14,Unknown,"Is party for, uh, New York ""Yunkees"" and Coca-Cola."
07x14,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
07x14,Unknown,A Coca-Cola Yankees party?
07x14,Unknown,That sounds like a real thing.
07x14,Unknown,"Okay, now, Marshall, take three steps forward, while ducking underneath the broken ceiling fan."
07x14,Unknown,Now look to your left and spit.
07x14,Unknown,"(spits, sizzles)"
07x14,Unknown,That's the water heater.
07x14,Unknown,Want to stay away from that.
07x14,Unknown,That baby is hotter than the Widow Rodriguez in a unitard.
07x14,Unknown,"Okay, now past the washer and dryer is the hardest part."
07x14,Unknown,You're gonna have to belly-crawl underneath the ping-pong table and don't so much as nudge it.
07x14,Unknown,Why not?
07x14,Unknown,Because there are
07x14,Unknown,900 dominos set up in the shape of Barbara Eden.
07x14,Unknown,"Big, big"
07x14,Unknown,I Dream Of Jeannie

07x14,Unknown,I'm clear.
07x14,Unknown,"(thud, dominos falling)"
07x14,Unknown,(dominos continue falling)
07x14,Unknown,"I don't know what that sound is, Mickey."
07x14,Unknown,That's the sound of Barbara Eden never banging me.
07x14,Unknown,That's what that is.
07x14,Unknown,"Dad, get it back."
07x14,(quietly),Come on.
07x14,Unknown,(beep)
07x14,Unknown,"Okay, Marshall, take three steps forward, and you should be at the fuse box."
07x14,Unknown,Do you think he made it?
07x14,Unknown,I did it!
07x14,Unknown,"No, Marshall..."
07x14,Unknown,you
07x14,Unknown,did it.
07x14,Unknown,Narrator
07x14,Fun fact,that night inspired Mickey's one and only successful board game--
07x14,Unknown,♪ With splintery floorboards and rusty nails ♪
07x14,Unknown,♪ Make sure you don't get impaled ♪
07x14,Unknown,♪ Lites Out!

07x14,Unknown,Brought to you by Aldrin Games!
07x14,Unknown,"Well, judging from how many clients that hooker has serviced, I'd say we've been here almost an hour."
07x14,Unknown,"Ted, we've been robbed."
07x14,Unknown,Better Lily and New Marshall would never rob us.
07x14,Unknown,They're our best friends.
07x14,Unknown,(squealing)
07x14,Unknown,(speaking Russian)
07x14,Unknown,"Damn it, Ted."
07x14,Unknown,New Marshall is an escaped zoo bear and the only thing that Better Lily is better at than our Lily is over-the-pants hand stuff.
07x14,Unknown,I'm assuming.
07x14,Unknown,I'll admit it.
07x14,Unknown,I can't lead this group.
07x14,Unknown,We need Marshall and Lily.
07x14,Unknown,"But they're gone, aren't they?"
07x14,Unknown,"I mean, it'll go from seeing them a couple times a week, to a couple times a month, and then it'll just be holiday parties."
07x14,Unknown,"Then the years pass, and you find out Marshall's dead, and you're there for Lily emotionally at first, but then it becomes sexual, and you feel guilty, but maybe that guilt just makes it dirtier and better..."
07x14,Unknown,"No, I won't let that happen."
07x14,Unknown,Especially that last part.
07x14,Unknown,"Look, I know I've been a little drunk and naive tonight, but here's what's gonna happen."
07x14,Unknown,"First, we're gonna leave a note for Better Lily and Arvydas, they're worriers."
07x14,Unknown,"Oh, buddy. Then, we're gonna go see Only Marshall and One-Of-A-Kind Lily because they're our best friends and they're only"
07x14,Unknown,46 minutes away.
07x14,Unknown,Are you with me?
07x14,Unknown,"Kind of resent the power grab, but okay, let's go!"
07x14,Unknown,"Hey, do you want to come to Long Island with us?"
07x14,Unknown,"Uh, well, still a few more hours before the sun comes up."
07x14,Unknown,Both
07x14,,So...
07x14,Unknown,No. No?
07x14,Unknown,Is that bad?
07x14,Unknown,(exhales)
07x14,Unknown,"No, it's great."
07x14,Unknown,"Ooh, that felt so good."
07x14,Unknown,I hate doing things and going anywhere!
07x14,Unknown,"Oh, new experiences suck!"
07x14,Unknown,(laughing)
07x14,Unknown,"While we're at it, I hate high-fiving you!"
07x14,Unknown,I know.
07x14,Unknown,"We're adults who are sleeping together, not teens pledging a frat."
07x14,Unknown,"Oh, man, I really liked the high-five."
07x14,Unknown,Narrator
07x14,Unknown,"The next morning, Marshall and Lily woke up to a surprise."
07x14,Unknown,(wind chimes clatter)
07x14,Unknown,"Hey, what are... what are you guys doing here?"
07x14,Unknown,Just wanted to make sure this key worked.
07x14,Unknown,(sighs)
07x14,Unknown,We missed you.
07x14,Unknown,Give mama a hug.
07x14,Unknown,All
07x14,,Oh...
07x14,Unknown,Don't check your voicemail.
07x14,Unknown,Y-You might have a couple weird ones.
07x14,Unknown,You hear this?!
07x14,Unknown,This is the sound of me moving on.
07x14,Unknown,(whooping)
07x14,Unknown,(giggles)
07x14,Unknown,"Yeah, I'm a stripper."
07x14,Unknown,"Okay, who wants pancakes?"
07x14,Unknown,(gasps)
07x14,Unknown,Which two of you want pancakes?
07x14,Unknown,I'll make more.
07x14,Unknown,"Oh, good-good-good, 'cause I want pancakes."
07x14,Unknown,There you go.
07x14,Unknown,"Thank you, okay."
07x14,Unknown,Enjoy them.
07x14,Unknown,"Hey, honey, look, I'm sorry I was a jerk before."
07x14,Unknown,Okay? I'll leave right after breakfast.
07x14,Unknown,I'll crash with some friends.
07x14,Unknown,"Dad, you know what?"
07x14,Unknown,You can stay.
07x14,Unknown,"Oh, thank God."
07x14,Unknown,I got no friends.
07x14,Unknown,"I'll be here two weeks, tops."
07x14,Unknown,Narrator
07x14,Unknown,It wasn't two weeks.
07x14,Unknown,Would the five of us always live within a few minutes of that booth?
07x14,Unknown,"No, that's life, kids, but here's what I discovered."
07x14,Unknown,Our booth was wherever the five of us were together.
07x14,Unknown,"That's right, Widow Rodriguez."
07x14,Unknown,Stretch it.
07x14,Unknown,Work those gams.
07x14,Unknown,"Ooh, yeah."
07x14,Unknown,Grab that left arm.
07x14,Unknown,Clutch that chest.
07x14,Unknown,Fall down really fast.
07x14,Unknown,"Oh, my God! Somebody call 911!"
07x15,Unknown,"Dad, we need to talk."
07x15,Unknown,Is it about the bees?
07x15,Unknown,Bees? We're throwing a housewarming party in two weeks.
07x15,Unknown,Oh.
07x15,Unknown,"It's gonna be friends, neighbors..."
07x15,Unknown,"Did he say... did he say ""bees""?"
07x15,"Yeah. Marshall's been working very long hours lately, so I have been planning this whole party by myself, and everything's in place","the food, the wine."
07x15,Unknown,I even found a rare Gouda on the Internet.
07x15,Unknown,Oh.
07x15,Unknown,Getting back to these bees...
07x15,Bottom line,"this party is very important to me, so I can only assume--"
07x15,Unknown,and I say this with love--
07x15,Unknown,you're gonna ruin it.
07x15,Unknown,"Lily, I promise I won't ruin your party."
07x15,Unknown,I'll be charming and convivial.
07x15,Unknown,A regular Burt Reynolds.
07x15,Unknown,You have absolutely nothing to worry about.
07x15,Unknown,Tell us about the bees!
07x15,Unknown,"Well, all right, since you asked."
07x15,Unknown,"I'm starting up a business cultivating all-organic, artisanal honey."
07x15,Unknown,"That's right, I'm a job creator."
07x15,Unknown,Oh. So this party...
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, Lily, wait. Um, if you don't mind, I just, I have one follow-up."
07x15,Unknown,Where are you doing this exactly?
07x15,Unknown,"Downstairs-- there's 10,000 bees in the basement."

07x15,Unknown,Both
07x15,,Happy housewarming!
07x15,Unknown,"Hey, guys."
07x15,Unknown,Robin here has spent all day learning how to make kugel.
07x15,Unknown,Couldn't figure it out--
07x15,Unknown,this is from Zabar's.
07x15,Unknown,Can we heat it up in your oven?
07x15,Unknown,Faster than heating it up in the refrigerator.
07x15,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x15,Unknown,I've had a few cocktails.
07x15,Unknown,and you might find yourself worrying if something's gonna go wrong.
07x15,Unknown,"Well, don't."
07x15,Unknown,What you should worry about is everything going wrong.
07x15,Unknown,And what's really scary is how quickly that can happen.
07x15,Unknown,"At Lily and Marshall's housewarming party for instance, it only took five minutes."
07x15,Unknown,"Now, a lot happened in those five minutes."
07x15,Unknown,You know what? I'm gonna take this room by room.
07x15,Unknown,We'll start in the living room.
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, no, that's not what you want."
07x15,Unknown,What?
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, nothing. So, you think this is going pretty well?"
07x15,Unknown,"Baby, are you kidding?"
07x15,Unknown,You single-handedly pulled off the party of the year.
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, stop it. I used both hands."
07x15,Unknown,"So, what can I do to help?"
07x15,Unknown,"Honey, this is your first night off in however long."
07x15,Unknown,You just relax and keep knocking back those cocktails.
07x15,Unknown,Mr. Cootes.
07x15,Unknown,"Hey, isn't it nice to finally have a night off?"
07x15,Unknown,It is. But tonight is not
07x15,Unknown,that
07x15,Unknown,night.
07x15,Unknown,We're going back to the office in 45 minutes.
07x15,Unknown,"But, sir, this is our housewarming party."
07x15,Unknown,"You know, Mother Earth is also having a ""housewarming"" party, too, only hers ends with humankind at the bottom of a rising ocean, passing through the digestive tract of a stingray."
07x15,Unknown,"By the way, it's a lovely home."
07x15,Unknown,"Mr. Cootes, I know you're a vegan, so I, uh, I got some vegan spring rolls for you over there."
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, nummies!"
07x15,Unknown,You're going back to work?
07x15,Unknown,"Sheez, Marshall, you are as busy as a..."
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, gosh, what are you as busy as?"
07x15,Unknown,Please don't talk about the bees.
07x15,Unknown,I was gonna say Nicolas Cage.
07x15,Unknown,That guy is in everything.
07x15,Unknown,Let's just put on some music.
07x15,Unknown,♪
07x15,Unknown,"I'll, uh, I'll bring out the Gouda, we'll open a couple bottles of wine... that are in the basement."
07x15,Unknown,"All right, I'll get my beekeeper's suit."
07x15,Unknown,You should be happy about the bees.
07x15,Unknown,They're keeping the mice at bay.
07x15,Unknown,We have mice?
07x15,Unknown,"Not with all these bees flying around, we don't."
07x15,Unknown,You're welcome.
07x15,Unknown,"Ted, baby Gouda's coming out. Look alive."
07x15,Unknown,Are you a vegan?
07x15,Unknown,What?
07x15,Unknown,Ooh-ee!
07x15,Unknown,"Kitchen, now."
07x15,Unknown,I can't believe that he's making us go to work tonight.
07x15,Unknown,Are... you... a... vegan?
07x15,Unknown,"Um, no."
07x15,Unknown,"Uh-huh. And when you were shoveling the spring rolls down your gullet, did you happen to notice a little sign next to the plate marked ""Vegan""?"
07x15,Unknown,I think there's been some mistake.
07x15,Unknown,You could have had anything on that table!
07x15,Unknown,Anything at all!
07x15,Unknown,"Mini pizzas, bacon-wrapped figs, pigs in blankets."
07x15,Unknown,There was even talk of an inbound Gouda!
07x15,Unknown,"But no, no, you had to have the one thing that someone with my dietary preferences can eat."
07x15,Unknown,"Look, I didn't eat the spring rolls."
07x15,Unknown,Liar!
07x15,Unknown,Your breath reeks of shredded carrots and deceit!
07x15,Unknown,"Okay, okay, maybe I did eat your precious spring rolls."
07x15,Unknown,Oh...
07x15,Unknown,"What are you gonna do about it,"
07x15,Unknown,hippie?
07x15,Unknown,(woman screams)
07x15,Unknown,It's fine. Everything's fine.
07x15,Unknown,"Young man, are you suggesting fisticuffs... as in with our fists?"
07x15,Unknown,And feet--
07x15,Unknown,I'm a kicker.
07x15,Unknown,"Well, well, looks like I just started eating white meat again."
07x15,Unknown,I will bite and scratch you like a wolverine.
07x15,Unknown,"May I warn you, I have been in a fight before."
07x15,Unknown,So have I... sort of.
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, God."
07x15,Unknown,Mr. Cootes. Hi.
07x15,Unknown,Did you see that we had hummus and veggies?
07x15,Unknown,There's hummus and veggies?

07x15,Unknown,(groans)
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, man."
07x15,Unknown,Sorry about that.
07x15,Unknown,"I don't need this right now, Ted."
07x15,Unknown,I shouldn't do this.
07x15,Unknown,I shouldn't do this.
07x15,Unknown,What?
07x15,Unknown,This is a bad idea. This is a bad idea!
07x15,Unknown,What is?
07x15,Unknown,I should just go. I should just go!
07x15,Unknown,"Okay, okay, just tell me what is going on."
07x15,Unknown,"I love my penis, Robin."
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, Barney, you promised."
07x15,Unknown,I do! I love it!
07x15,Unknown,"If I could kiss it, I would."
07x15,Unknown,I'd be lying if I told you I hadn't tried.
07x15,Unknown,I'm not comfortable with this conversation.
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, come on, Robin, it's my penis we're talking about."
07x15,Unknown,You've seen her-- she's magnificent.
07x15,Unknown,She?
07x15,Unknown,"Every penis is a girl, Robin. Everyone knows that."
07x15,Unknown,Like... ships and lake monsters.
07x15,Unknown,And Gouda!
07x15,Unknown,She's a beauta.
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, Gouda."
07x15,Unknown,"Well, I'll be back."
07x15,Unknown,"Most of me, anyway."
07x15,Unknown,Don't eat that.
07x15,Unknown,What?
07x15,Unknown,"Whoops! Oh, it's ruined."
07x15,Unknown,It's not ruined. Ten second rule.
07x15,Unknown,"Eight, nine, ten, and it's ruined."
07x15,Unknown,This whole party's ruined.
07x15,Unknown,"I got a basement full of bees, and Ted almost got into a fight with Mr. Cootes."
07x15,Unknown,"Lily, look around."
07x15,Unknown,Everyone's having an amazing time.
07x15,Unknown,It's a great party.
07x15,Unknown,"Okay, maybe it's not a total disaster."
07x15,Unknown,(Mickey screaming)
07x15,Unknown,What the hell was that?!
07x15,Unknown,(screaming)
07x15,Unknown,Narrator
07x15,Unknown,So that's what happened in the living room.
07x15,Unknown,Now I'm gonna tell you what happened in the dining room.
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, no, that's not what you want."
07x15,Unknown,"Man, I can't believe these are vegan."
07x15,Unknown,"I've had, like, 20 of 'em."
07x15,Unknown,I should get the name of this caterer.
07x15,Unknown,It's my kitten's Bat Mitzvah next week.
07x15,Unknown,She's finally becoming a cat.
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, God, you are crazy."
07x15,Unknown,About cats.
07x15,Unknown,Cats are so honest and real with their affections.
07x15,Unknown,"Ever since my divorce, it's just been one liar after another."
07x15,Unknown,"That's why it's so refreshing to meet someone honest like you, Special Agent Gary Powers."
07x15,Unknown,Listen...
07x15,Unknown,I think we can agree there's something here.
07x15,Unknown,Something big... that looks and probably feels real.
07x15,Unknown,Maybe... we can go back to your place.
07x15,Unknown,I can't ask you to delay intercepting those asteroids.
07x15,Unknown,I do need to intercept those asteroids.
07x15,Unknown,I think we need to have sex right now.
07x15,Unknown,Meet me in the upstairs guest bedroom in two minutes.
07x15,Unknown,(both chuckle)
07x15,Unknown,I'm just looking for the vegan spring rolls.
07x15,Unknown,"Last one, sorry."
07x15,Unknown,Two minutes.
07x15,Unknown,How can they all be gone? The party just started.
07x15,Unknown,"I know, right?"
07x15,Unknown,Let's just put on some music.
07x15,Unknown,♪
07x15,Unknown,"I'll, uh, I'll bring out the Gouda, we'll open a couple of bottles of wine... that are in the basement."
07x15,Unknown,Some jerk was just here.
07x15,Unknown,"And he was all, like, ""I can't believe these are vegan."
07x15,Unknown,"I've had, like, 20 of 'em."""
07x15,Unknown,Point me into the direction of this scoundrel.
07x15,Unknown,Um... it was that guy.
07x15,Unknown,"Ted, baby Gouda's coming out. Look alive."
07x15,Unknown,"Lily, these spring rolls... ooh-ee!"
07x15,Unknown,"Kitchen, now."
07x15,Unknown,I can't believe that he's making us go to work tonight.
07x15,Unknown,"I mean, I think it's time that somebody took him aside and told him this is not how you treat your staff."
07x15,Unknown,"Well, I'm sort of busy with the party right now."
07x15,Unknown,"Fine. I'll do it myself. But he's gonna scream at me, and you know that I can't stand up to screaming."
07x15,Unknown,Just go talk to him! I think I should go talk to him.
07x15,Unknown,"Barney... Ah, Lily, Ted ate all of the spring rolls."
07x15,Unknown,You could have had anything on that table!
07x15,Unknown,"Mini pizzas, bacon-wrapped figs, pigs in blankets."
07x15,Unknown,There was even talk of an inbound Gouda!
07x15,Unknown,"Robin. Okay, listen, I need your help."
07x15,Unknown,"I'm about to get in a screaming match with my boss, and I'm not good at getting screamed at, so I need you to warm me up."
07x15,Unknown,How? I want you to scream at me.
07x15,Unknown,"You know, like you do to strangers on the street at the slightest provocation."
07x15,Unknown,I don't do that.
07x15,Unknown,"Come on, lay some of that classic Scherbatsky mean son of a b*tch on me."
07x15,Unknown,Treat me like I'm a Girl Scout trying to sell you cookies.
07x15,Unknown,Four dollars a box and you're out of Thin Mints?!
07x15,Unknown,You green little...! I don't do that!
07x15,Unknown,"Come on, scream at me."
07x15,Unknown,(woman screams)
07x15,Unknown,Like that.
07x15,Unknown,It's fine. Everything's fine.
07x15,Unknown,"Marshall, there is plenty of stuff that I don't get mad about, like the fact that you're serving pigs in blankets without hot mustard."
07x15,Unknown,I'm not the type of person to be driven crazy by a host who refuses to provide delicious hot mustard in which to dip my pigs in blankets!
07x15,Unknown,I'm the type of girl who... keeps her cool.
07x15,Unknown,Who keeps her cool.
07x15,Unknown,"Wait. Whoa, baby, are you okay?"
07x15,Unknown,Of course. This party is great.
07x15,Unknown,"I am handling this. Oh, God."
07x15,Unknown,No...
07x15,Unknown,Hummus and veggies?
07x15,Unknown,I'm looking for hummus and veggies.
07x15,Unknown,"Robin, can I talk to you about something very dear to me?"
07x15,Unknown,Promise me this isn't about your penis.
07x15,Unknown,I promise it isn't about my penis.
07x15,Unknown,I'm sorry.
07x15,Unknown,"Excuse me, sir, could I talk to you in the kitchen?"
07x15,Unknown,Sorry about that.
07x15,Unknown,"I don't need this right now, Ted."
07x15,Unknown,"I swear, if there's one more crisis..."
07x15,Unknown,"Well, the bees escaped their enclosure, but no reason to ""bee"" concerned."
07x15,Unknown,(laughs)
07x15,Unknown,"No, there is, we're in big trouble."
07x15,Unknown,What is that smell?
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, I doused my suit with kerosene."
07x15,Unknown,All beekeepers do this.
07x15,Unknown,"Dad, just take off the suit right now."
07x15,Unknown,"All right, fine."
07x15,Unknown,"Every 30 seconds, there's another crisis that needs to be dealt with and I have to deal with it."
07x15,Unknown,"This is... Oh, God."
07x15,Unknown,"This is parenthood, isn't it?"
07x15,Unknown,So they say.
07x15,Unknown,"Okay, it's official."
07x15,Unknown,"I thought I could do it, but I can't."
07x15,Unknown,"No, Marshall's always at work."
07x15,Unknown,He's got to go back tonight.
07x15,Unknown,And I don't know if I can handle a life that's just one crisis after another.
07x15,Unknown,"Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna give you a little piece of..."
07x15,Unknown,Gouda!
07x15,Unknown,God.
07x15,Unknown,Crisis? Crisis.
07x15,Unknown,Don't eat that. Whoops!
07x15,Unknown,What?
07x15,Unknown,"Gouda's out, Ted. Don't sleep on the Gouda."
07x15,Unknown,Wouldn't dream of it.
07x15,Unknown,So Lily told me you have to go back to work tonight?
07x15,Unknown,"No, I don't have to go back to work tonight."
07x15,Unknown,Mr. Cootes and I came to an understanding.
07x15,Unknown,"But, hey, what's going on with Robin?"
07x15,Unknown,I called her a mean son of a b*tch and she took it all weird.
07x15,Unknown,She did?
07x15,Unknown,Yeah.
07x15,Unknown,"Crazy, right?"
07x15,Unknown,"Hey, buddy."
07x15,Unknown,Best housewarming party ever.
07x15,Unknown,Everybody's abuzz.
07x15,Unknown,Abuzz.
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, good one, Mickey."
07x15,Unknown,"But, hey, you're right."
07x15,Unknown,Great party.
07x15,Unknown,(man screaming)
07x15,Unknown,What the hell was that?!
07x15,Unknown,(man screaming)
07x15,Unknown,Narrator
07x15,Unknown,And that's what happened in the dining room.
07x15,Unknown,Now I'm gonna tell you what happened in the kitchen.
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, no, that's not what you want."
07x15,Unknown,Barney
07x15,,"Man, I can't believe these are vegan."
07x15,Unknown,Back to our fight?
07x15,Unknown,Back to our fight.
07x15,Unknown,I cannot believe you screamed at that woman at Zabar's.
07x15,Unknown,She was trying to cut in line.
07x15,Unknown,She was gonna get the last kugel.
07x15,Unknown,She was 90 years old.
07x15,Unknown,It was probably gonna be her last kugel.
07x15,Unknown,"Sometimes in life, you have to be assertive and stand up for yourself."
07x15,Unknown,You called her a whore.
07x15,Unknown,Who wears that much makeup?!
07x15,Unknown,Old ladies!
07x15,Unknown,Who take money for sex. Exactly.
07x15,Unknown,"Look, I'm sorry."
07x15,Unknown,"If I would've left things in your dainty, lily-white, never-ripped-"
07x15,Unknown,"an-old-lady's-wig-off hands, we would be kugel-free right now."
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, so, what, I'm too nice?"
07x15,Unknown,You never stand up for yourself.
07x15,Unknown,Remember that sixth grader who kept stealing your lunch?
07x15,Unknown,"High school was a tough time for me, okay?"
07x15,Unknown,And that girl was muscular.
07x15,Unknown,Forearms like Popeye.
07x15,Unknown,How do you even know about that?
07x15,Unknown,Marshall told me. He also said that you had your mom stop making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because of that girl's nut allergy.
07x15,Unknown,I didn't want to add to her health problems.
07x15,Unknown,She was already in a wheelchair.
07x15,Unknown,"Okay, so what?"
07x15,Unknown,"I would rather be nice than be like you, always getting in fights about stuff that's not even worth fighting about."
07x15,Unknown,Disagree.
07x15,Unknown,It's like Sun Tzu wrote in
07x15,Unknown,"The Art of w*r,"
07x15,Unknown,"""Never give up. Never surrender."""
07x15,Unknown,That was Tim Allen in
07x15,Unknown,Galaxy Quest.
07x15,Unknown,"Whatever, dude."
07x15,Unknown,"Your problem is any time you're faced with the least bit of confrontation, you run away."
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, I run away from confrontation?"
07x15,Unknown,"Ted, baby Gouda's coming out."
07x15,Unknown,Look alive.
07x15,Unknown,Whoops. Son of a...!
07x15,Unknown,I'm sorry.
07x15,Unknown,(clears throat)
07x15,Unknown,Maybe that was my fault.
07x15,Unknown,You think?
07x15,Unknown,You're right in my snack track.
07x15,Unknown,"Hey, nice beekeeper suit."
07x15,Unknown,"Do you know that, uh, most bees are left-handed?"
07x15,Unknown,Did you know bees hate the smell of kerosene?
07x15,Unknown,"I knew that. Geez, what do you think, this is my first day as a beekeeper?"
07x15,Unknown,Nice. Oh.
07x15,Unknown,(bees buzzing) Is that true about bees and kerosene?
07x15,Unknown,I don't know.
07x15,Unknown,Barney...
07x15,Unknown,"Ah, Lily, Ted ate all of the spring rolls."
07x15,Unknown,"Barney, that woman you were talking to, our neighbor Geraldine, some guy slept with her and didn't call her, so she hunted him down and cut off a certain part of his anatomy with a cheese knife."
07x15,Unknown,(gasps)
07x15,Unknown,"So, whatever you do, don't sleep with her."
07x15,Unknown,"It's funny, she is, um, waiting for me in the guest bedroom right now."
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, God! Oh, God!"
07x15,Unknown,"That was the idea, but now forget it!"
07x15,Unknown,"Barney, this is a disaster."
07x15,Unknown,"I swear, if there is one... (gasps)"
07x15,Unknown,It's fine. Everything's fine.
07x15,Unknown,"Hey, ten second rule, right?"
07x15,Unknown,(Lily screams)
07x15,Unknown,It's fine. Everything's fine.
07x15,Unknown,Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
07x15,Unknown,"I know you're pregnant, but you need a glass of wine."
07x15,Unknown,I got that cheese off the Internet.
07x15,Unknown,I know you got it off the Internet.
07x15,Unknown,Why does that make it impressive?
07x15,Unknown,You know what else you can find on the Internet?
07x15,Unknown,Zoo animals masturbating.
07x15,Unknown,There's one of a walrus.
07x15,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x15,Unknown,He's...
07x15,Unknown,Oh.
07x15,Unknown,(groans)
07x15,Unknown,(mutters)
07x15,Unknown,(gasps)
07x15,Unknown,(panting)
07x15,Unknown,No...
07x15,Unknown,(bees buzzing)
07x15,Unknown,(panting)
07x15,Unknown,"Excuse me, sir, could I talk to you in the kitchen?"
07x15,Unknown,(sighs)
07x15,Unknown,(clears throat)
07x15,Unknown,"Mr. Cootes, I am not going back to work tonight."
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, no, she didn't just say that."
07x15,Unknown,(laughs)
07x15,Unknown,"Mickey, could we just have a minute?"
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, yeah. Sure."
07x15,Unknown,"Marshall, look, I know when you started with this firm, it was all fun and games."
07x15,Unknown,The office chair races were particularly spirited.
07x15,Unknown,"Until, of course, Gail went down the stairs."
07x15,Unknown,"But for one brief moment, boy, did she fly."
07x15,Unknown,(sighs)
07x15,Unknown,"I'm not here, I'm not here."
07x15,Unknown,"Mr. Cootes, you're working yourself to death."
07x15,Unknown,Just cut loose a little.
07x15,Unknown,"Have a beer, find a hobby."
07x15,Unknown,"Look, son, it's very simple."
07x15,Unknown,"Um, Mother Earth doesn't get a night off."
07x15,Unknown,Neither do you.
07x15,Unknown,"Well, then I quit."
07x15,Unknown,And I don't know if I can handle a life that's just one crisis after another.
07x15,Unknown,"Lily, listen to me. I'm gonna give you a little piece of..."
07x15,Unknown,Gouda!
07x15,Unknown,Maybe he's right.
07x15,Unknown,Maybe I do need a hobby.
07x15,Unknown,"Well, hey, how about beekeeping?"
07x15,Unknown,Me? No. I-I don't know the first thing about bees.
07x15,Unknown,You want to know a secret?
07x15,Unknown,Neither do I.
07x15,Unknown,It's not a secret.
07x15,Unknown,Let me try this thing on.
07x15,Unknown,I'm gonna give you some privacy.
07x15,Unknown,"All right, thank you."
07x15,Unknown,Okay.
07x15,Unknown,"Hey, buddy."
07x15,Unknown,Best housewarming party ever.
07x15,Unknown,Everybody's abuzz.
07x15,Unknown,"(bees buzzing, timer beeping)"
07x15,Unknown,"Okay, maybe it's not a total disaster."
07x15,Unknown,Great party.
07x15,Unknown,(screaming)
07x15,Unknown,(screaming continues)
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, my God. Oh!"
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, Mr. Cootes!"
07x15,Unknown,"Mr. Cootes, are you okay?!"
07x15,Unknown,That was amazing!
07x15,Unknown,Did you see me?!
07x15,Unknown,I flew through the air like a human fireball and didn't get a scratch.
07x15,Unknown,"Eat your heart out, Gail!"
07x15,Unknown,(laughs)
07x15,Unknown,"God, I feel so alive!"
07x15,Unknown,I want to drink a beer.
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."
07x15,Unknown,"Okay, one beer, coming right up."
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, and, uh, Marshall, I think we'll take the night off tonight, okay?"
07x15,Unknown,"Sounds good, yeah."
07x15,Unknown,But I'll see you Monday?
07x15,Unknown,Of course.
07x15,Unknown,Yeah.
07x15,Unknown,(sighs)
07x15,Unknown,"You know, Robin, I've been thinking about it."
07x15,Unknown,Guess it's kind of nice you're such a badass.
07x15,Unknown,"It's pretty badass you're so nice, Ted."
07x15,Unknown,Was I supposed to close the basement door?
07x15,Unknown,(bees buzzing)
07x15,Unknown,"God, this feels so right!"
07x15,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x15,Unknown,We're so great together.
07x15,Unknown,I want to spend every minute of every day with you.
07x15,Unknown,I never let you out of my sight for one second.
07x15,Unknown,"Not one second, not one second. I don't!"
07x15,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x15,Unknown,"Oh, God!"
07x15,Unknown,My last lover was not like this.
07x15,Unknown,He was the worst!
07x15,Unknown,"Do you know, he didn't even come to my cat's bris."
07x15,Unknown,"I mean, what?"
07x15,Unknown,"Well, we showed him."
07x15,Unknown,"Yes, we did."
07x15,Unknown,"Let's just say, the punishment fit the crime."
07x15,Unknown,I can't wait to tell everybody that we're boyfriend and girlfriend!
07x15,Unknown,(bees buzzing)
07x15,Unknown,Let's do it tonight.
07x15,Unknown,"No, it's Lily and Marshall's party."
07x15,Unknown,We'll wait.
07x15,Unknown,We can do it at Mittens and Mr. Pepper's wedding.
07x15,Unknown,(bees buzzing)
07x15,Unknown,Or maybe something...
07x15,Unknown,(screaming)
07x16,Unknown,Sorry this is taking so long.
07x16,Unknown,He kicked for everybody else.
07x16,Unknown,It's hard for the little guy to perform under pressure.
07x16,Unknown,Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night.
07x16,Unknown,(laughter)
07x16,Unknown,"Whoa! It was small, but I think I felt something."
07x16,Unknown,Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
07x16,Unknown,"Stop laughing at it, Lily."
07x16,Unknown,All
07x16,,Top ten things Marshall said on his wedding night!
07x16,Unknown,Can we please talk about something other than my wedding night?
07x16,Unknown,Absolutely. Let's talk about last night.
07x16,Unknown,It was a night like any other.
07x16,Unknown,I was just about to get laid...
07x16,Unknown,"Hey, Barney, I need your help."
07x16,Unknown,"This hottie I'm talking to is meeting her friend at a club, so I need a wingman."
07x16,Unknown,"Well, just so you know, I'd be giving up a sure thing here."
07x16,Unknown,Hey!
07x16,Unknown,Are you
07x16,Unknown,not
07x16,Unknown,a sure thing?
07x16,Unknown,"Yeah, I am."
07x16,Unknown,"This ""friend"" of yours better be even hotter and dumber than this one."
07x16,Unknown,Wow! You have Enormous Penis Syndrome?
07x16,Unknown,I've never heard of that. Yeah.
07x16,That's the problem with E.P.S.,lack of awareness.
07x16,Unknown,That's why I'm organizing a 10K fun-run.
07x16,Unknown,"Of course, many of us will need wheelbarrows."
07x16,Unknown,You are so brave.
07x16,Unknown,And you are so understanding.
07x16,Unknown,Most people just stare at me like I'm some kind of freak in reinforced underwear.
07x16,Unknown,"Poor, baby."
07x16,Unknown,I can't imagine what you're going through because I never wear underwear.
07x16,Unknown,(coughs) Jackpot!
07x16,Unknown,You want to get out of here?
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, I don't know. This is all moving kind of fast. Okay."
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, but before we go, I should mention my condition."
07x16,It's called,I'm Not a Gullible Dumbass Disorder.
07x16,Unknown,"Okay, just stop."
07x16,Unknown,You have no chance with me.
07x16,Unknown,We're just here as backups for our friends.
07x16,Unknown,"Hey, how did you two meet, anyway?"
07x16,Unknown,"No, we're not doing that first date dance where you pretend everything I say is fascinating, thinking it'll somehow get you into my pants."
07x16,Unknown,What? Guys don't do that!
07x16,Unknown,Goat cheese? Fascinating!
07x16,Unknown,"What else are you allergic to, huh?"
07x16,Unknown,"You owe me three hours for last night, Mosby."
07x16,Unknown,"I'm thinking, laser tag tournament in Newark this weekend."
07x16,Unknown,"Ted can pass for under 18, right?"
07x16,Unknown,It's a father-son thing.
07x16,Unknown,"Marshall, we should get going. Any later, and we'll be riding the Drunk Train. Oh."
07x16,Unknown,The Drunk Train?
07x16,Unknown,It's the last train of the night back to Long Island. It's a mess.
07x16,Unknown,Lily
07x16,,"Just a bunch of drunk, sloppy idiots, fresh off a night of partying in the city, just desperate to hook up with anything that moves."
07x16,Unknown,Yeah. Bye.
07x16,Unknown,Marshall
07x16,,See you.
07x16,Unknown,"New plan, Ted."
07x16,Unknown,So this father-son thing.
07x16,Unknown,"You know, a backwards baseball cap really youngs me down."
07x16,Unknown,All aboard!

07x16,Unknown,The Drunk Train
07x16,Unknown,"Original Air Date on February 13, 2012"
07x16,Unknown,Narrator
07x16,Unknown,"For Valentine's weekend, Lily and Marshall invited Kevin and Robin on a couple's getaway to Vermont."
07x16,Unknown,Both
07x16,,Mmm.
07x16,Unknown,"16 years together, and still so in love."
07x16,Unknown,Marshall
07x16,,Mm. What's your secret?
07x16,Unknown,The key to relationships is understanding the difference between hearing and listening.
07x16,Unknown,It's about respecting your partner's...
07x16,Unknown,Opinions on...
07x16,Unknown,"Hey, shh, shh, shh. Kind of on a roll here."
07x16,Unknown,"Relationships are a give and take, and that's why it's important to never keep score."
07x16,Unknown,Lily
07x16,,"Yeah, like how Barney's holding these three hours over Ted's head."
07x16,Unknown,"If they were a couple, they'd never work."
07x16,Unknown,"Obviously. Ted's a Taurus, and Barney is such a Scorpio."
07x16,Unknown,Good advice. Don't keep score.
07x16,Unknown,They're not even close to finished.
07x16,Unknown,"How do we not keep score, you ask?"
07x16,Unknown,Huh. Hm.
07x16,Unknown,"Sounds like somebody want to hear some examples, sweetie."
07x16,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
07x16,Unknown,I'm just gonna close my eyes until it's all over.
07x16,Unknown,Top ten things Lily said on her wedding night.
07x16,Unknown,Solid.
07x16,Unknown,Here's one.
07x16,Unknown,"Every time Marshall's mom comes to visit us,"
07x16,Unknown,we have to put out all the tacky Minnesota gifts
07x16,Unknown,she's bought us over the years.
07x16,Unknown,"Hi, Mom! Hi, Mrs. Eriksen!"
07x16,Unknown,Marshall.
07x16,Unknown,Uh-huh. I don't see the gopher-hair tea cozy I made you.
07x16,Unknown,(sighs) Guess it wasn't good enough for Lily.
07x16,Unknown,"But I'd never hold that over Marshall, because if I did, he'd owe me big-time."
07x16,Unknown,Just like I would never hold it over you for dragging me to that experimental theater piece.
07x16,Unknown,(woman screaming onstage)
07x16,Unknown,"(sustained, intense screaming)"
07x16,Unknown,Is it... is it just screaming?
07x16,Unknown,But we don't keep score.
07x16,Unknown,"Gotcha, loud and clear. Don't keep score."
07x16,Unknown,"Because if we did, then Marshall would owe me for k*lling my cousin's dog."
07x16,Unknown,How did I know that he would eat my wallet?
07x16,Unknown,Why was your wallet filled with chocolate?!
07x16,Unknown,So we're back to this argument!
07x16,Unknown,Narrator
07x16,Unknown,"That night, Barney and I found ourselves in a strange, new universe called..."
07x16,Unknown,The Drunk Train.
07x16,Unknown,Hey!
07x16,Unknown,Where has this heavenly vehicle been all my life?
07x16,Unknown,"Can you hear its inspiring chant, Ted?"
07x16,Unknown,"I think I can get laid, I think I can get laid."
07x16,Unknown,"It's-it's The Little Engine with Wood, The Whore-ient Express."
07x16,Unknown,The Long Island Tail Road!
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, I got one."
07x16,Unknown,Thomas the Spank Engine!
07x16,Unknown,"Ted, that is a children's book."
07x16,Unknown,(bottle shattering)
07x16,Unknown,"Okay, as fun as this place is, it's late."
07x16,Unknown,"So, what's our play?"
07x16,Unknown,"And don't say, ""The Siamese Twins"""""
07x16,Unknown,We're not stretching out another one of my jackets.
07x16,Unknown,"No, dude, this is the Drunk Train."
07x16,Unknown,We don't need a play!
07x16,Unknown,"All we have to do is sit back, play it cool, scope out the hotties, and by the end of the line, we will totally be sleeping with someone."
07x16,Unknown,(both snoring)
07x16,Unknown,(bottle smashing)
07x16,Unknown,"You know, you are so great."
07x16,Unknown,"You sat there listening to Marshall and Lily bicker all night, and you didn't complain once."
07x16,Unknown,"Well, I am a therapist, so I do plan on billing them."
07x16,Unknown,I also have a couple powerful medications that might help.
07x16,Unknown,Lily can't take anything; she's pregnant.
07x16,Unknown,I meant for us.
07x16,Unknown,"If we're getting through five more meals and a sleigh ride with those guys, we need to be spaced out of our gourds."
07x16,Unknown,"Well, if we are keeping score, I owe you one weekend, mister."
07x16,Unknown,I was thinking a little longer than that.
07x16,Unknown,What do you mean?
07x16,Unknown,"Robin, will you marry me?"
07x16,Unknown,"Look, I know this is fast."
07x16,Unknown,I'm just excited to start a life with you.
07x16,Unknown,If that's what you want.
07x16,Unknown,Wow.
07x16,Unknown,Um...
07x16,Unknown,I'm-I'm not saying no.
07x16,Unknown,I'm-I'm not saying anything.
07x16,Unknown,"I just, um... I-I need some time to think."
07x16,Unknown,I totally understand.
07x16,Unknown,"Um, take as much time as you need."
07x16,Unknown,"I'll just, uh... I'll just keep this here until you're ready."
07x16,Unknown,(laughs)
07x16,Unknown,(sighs)
07x16,Unknown,Any chance we could put that bad boy away for now?
07x16,Unknown,"It's really just staring at us, isn't it?"
07x16,(panting),Ted! Ted! Ted!
07x16,Unknown,I thought of some new great names for the Drunk Train.
07x16,Unknown,Slamtrak!
07x16,Unknown,Uh-huh.
07x16,Unknown,The Chatta-Nookie Choo-Choo!
07x16,Unknown,Thomas the Spank Engine! I said that one yesterday.
07x16,(in high-pitched voice),I don't think you did.
07x16,Unknown,Wow. Someone's had some coffee.
07x16,Unknown,Yeah. 18 cups!
07x16,Unknown,There is no way I'm falling asleep tonight!
07x16,Unknown,That Quinn girl is so wrong.
07x16,Unknown,"She said I could never love anything, but I love this train!"
07x16,Unknown,She said you could never love anything? That's intense.
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, you have no idea."
07x16,Unknown,Stop staring. Not gonna happen.
07x16,Unknown,Is there any way we can start over and get to know each other?
07x16,Unknown,"I already know you. Oh, really?"
07x16,Unknown,You wear a suit all the time.
07x16,Unknown,Obviously.
07x16,Unknown,You have a stupid rule about everything.
07x16,Unknown,"I pay for the meal, you handle my deal."
07x16,Unknown,That's just good manners.
07x16,Unknown,"But you end most nights alone at a strip club, feeling empty inside, telling yourself your life is somehow epic or classic or... legendary."
07x16,Unknown,I never say epic or classic.
07x16,Unknown,(laughs)
07x16,Unknown,Do you practice the dark arts?
07x16,Unknown,"No, they did not forget the potato salad in your takeout order!"
07x16,Unknown,(mimes mind exploding)
07x16,Unknown,Wh-What happened next?!
07x16,Unknown,"For the last time, I'm sorry."
07x16,Unknown,It's okay.
07x16,Unknown,Your debt is paid.
07x16,Unknown,You don't have to come on the Drunk Train anymore.
07x16,Unknown,"You're never gonna meet the one there, anyway."
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, screw the one!"
07x16,Unknown,What?
07x16,Unknown,Every date I've been on lately has been brutal.
07x16,Unknown,"Last week, I went out with a girl whose favorite band was"
07x16,Unknown,Glee.
07x16,Unknown,"Plus, it's almost Valentine's Day, and I'm alone without anything close to a girlfriend."
07x16,Unknown,So... all aboard!
07x16,Unknown,I have never been more proud of you.
07x16,Unknown,Come on.
07x16,Unknown,"Ted, tonight is gonna be epic--"
07x16,Unknown,wait for it-- dary! Wait.
07x16,Unknown,"No, that's not it."
07x16,Unknown,How do I usually say it? I hate this Quinn girl!
07x16,Unknown,"Well, I propose we order a bottle of wine."
07x16,(whispers loudly),Propose!
07x16,Unknown,Not propose. Suggest.
07x16,Unknown,"I'm not married to the idea. Lily, take it."
07x16,Unknown,Why don't we get an appetizer?
07x16,Unknown,How about the... onion rings?
07x16,Unknown,"I mean, diamond rings."
07x16,Unknown,"I mean, diamond circles."
07x16,Unknown,"I mean,"
07x16,Unknown,onion
07x16,Unknown,circles.
07x16,Unknown,"I know they're fattening, but I hear this place has great onion circles."
07x16,Unknown,"So, Robin, about not telling them?"
07x16,Unknown,The green salad looks interesting.
07x16,Unknown,You're so much better without him.
07x16,Unknown,"If you ask me, Vinnie's a real jerk."
07x16,Unknown,"Hey, don't you dare badmouth Vinnie!"
07x16,Unknown,Ow!
07x16,Unknown,So what do you do?
07x16,Unknown,"Well, I teach architecture, and I also..."
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, big man with a job."
07x16,Unknown,You think yore better than me?
07x16,Unknown,What...
07x16,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x16,Unknown,So... where do you live?
07x16,Unknown,I'm on the Upper West Side.
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, big man. Living in Manhattan."
07x16,Unknown,"What, you think you're better than me?"
07x16,Unknown,Ehhh!
07x16,Unknown,Ehhhh!
07x16,Unknown,You think you're better than me?!
07x16,Unknown,"Well, it's a close one."
07x16,Unknown,"Lily made 14 awkward references to marriage, and Marshall made an even 60."
07x16,Unknown,"I'm so sorry, Kevin."
07x16,Unknown,"It's okay. I'm gonna go to bed, but you guys think tomorrow we can stop with all the marriage talk?"
07x16,Unknown,I do. I do.
07x16,Unknown,That's a half a point each.
07x16,Unknown,See you in a minute.
07x16,Unknown,Okay.
07x16,Unknown,(sighs)
07x16,Unknown,So?
07x16,Unknown,Are you any closer to deciding? Ooh...
07x16,Unknown,"Uh... well, there is something you don't know."
07x16,Unknown,Um...
07x16,Unknown,Can you guys keep a secret?
07x16,Unknown,"Yeah. Well, some of us can."
07x16,Unknown,"Well, there's something I have been keeping from everyone for the last couple of months."
07x16,Unknown,Um...
07x16,Unknown,I found out that I can't have children.
07x16,Unknown,I'm so sorry.
07x16,Unknown,Yeah.
07x16,Unknown,Are you okay?
07x16,Unknown,I can't believe that we didn't know.
07x16,Unknown,"No, you know, I've had some... time to deal with this by myself, and..."
07x16,Unknown,I'm okay.
07x16,Unknown,For real.
07x16,Unknown,Are you sure?
07x16,Unknown,"Yeah. So... even though I love Kevin and I... think I want to say yes, I can't until I tell him."
07x16,Unknown,But I'm scared it'll end our relationship.
07x16,Unknown,Marshall
07x16,,"You know what, Robin?"
07x16,Unknown,"If it's meant to be, then it won't matter."
07x16,Unknown,"Yeah, you just have to tell him."
07x16,Unknown,(groans) Thank God we had the keys to Marshall and Lily's place.
07x16,Unknown,Pretty sure I told you that before you kicked in that side window.
07x16,Unknown,"You mean, before the ""burglars"" kicked in that side window and stole all of Lily's underwear."
07x16,Unknown,(groans)
07x16,Unknown,What the hell happened on that train?
07x16,Unknown,It was absolute chaos.
07x16,"Ted, when I was at M.I.T., my favorite Einstein quote was","""God doesn't play dice with the universe."""
07x16,Unknown,You didn't go to M.I.T.
07x16,Unknown,I didn't?
07x16,Unknown,Huh. I actually have no idea where you went to college.
07x16,Unknown,Who are you?
07x16,Unknown,"(chuckles) If we analyze the seemingly random patterns of the train, taking into account standard deviation, and assuming that epsilon approaches zero as angle delta approaches pi, we can conclude..."
07x16,Unknown,(snoring)
07x16,Unknown,"Damn it, Ted!"
07x16,Unknown,I was about to drop some sweet word play about logarithms and getting into a rhythm with my log.
07x16,Unknown,(snoring)
07x16,Unknown,I'll remember it.
07x16,Unknown,Narrator
07x16,Unknown,"The next morning, Robin mustered up all her courage and finally told Kevin her secret."
07x16,Unknown,"I know that this is a lot to process, so... you take all the time you need."
07x16,Unknown,And I understand... Robin... will you marry me?
07x16,Unknown,Yes.
07x16,Unknown,What are you doing?
07x16,Unknown,"The top speed of the Drunk Train is 73 miles per hour, and you factor in an aggregate of 32 boobs per car,"
07x16,Unknown,"28 of which are motorboatable, and you divide that... No, no, no!"
07x16,Unknown,This is all wrong!
07x16,Unknown,It should be so simple!
07x16,Unknown,"I mean, it's the Drunk Train!"
07x16,Unknown,"My God... it's been right in front of us the whole time. ""Get drunk"""""
07x16,Unknown,Yeah.
07x16,Unknown,Of course.
07x16,Unknown,"Good circling, Ted."
07x16,Unknown,This ain't my first word search.
07x16,Unknown,"So my Mom's already picked a date, venue and caterer for the wedding."
07x16,Unknown,But nothing's set in stone.
07x16,Unknown,My great-aunt's gonna sing.
07x16,Unknown,That's happening.
07x16,Unknown,Are you really okay with this?
07x16,Unknown,"Yeah, she's actually got a decent voice."
07x16,Unknown,"No, are you... are you okay with everything that we talked about?"
07x16,Unknown,"Of course, Robin, I love you."
07x16,Unknown,"Besides, there are other ways to have kids."
07x16,Unknown,"There's adoption, surrogacy..."
07x16,Unknown,"No, Kevin, it's not just that I can't have kids, I don't want kids."
07x16,Unknown,Oh.
07x16,Unknown,Okay.
07x16,Unknown,"Knowing that, do you want to take your proposal back?"
07x16,Unknown,Will you marry me?
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, you take such good care of me."
07x16,Unknown,Thanks for loaning me your shoes for my swollen feet. Ah!
07x16,Unknown,I owe you one.
07x16,Unknown,We have to stop this.
07x16,Unknown,Stop what?
07x16,Unknown,Keeping score.
07x16,Unknown,"You're growing a baby, our baby."
07x16,Unknown,So you're officially ahead of me for life.
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, thanks, sweetie."
07x16,Unknown,"Once we're parents, we have to be a team. Deal?"
07x16,Unknown,(baby crying)
07x16,Unknown,It's your turn!
07x16,Unknown,I was on point for six straight hours yesterday!
07x16,Unknown,Two of those hours were a nap and you know it!
07x16,Unknown,Let's go to the board!
07x16,Unknown,"I hope it's a soupy deuce, sucka."
07x16,Unknown,(chortles)
07x16,Unknown,Deal. We're a team.
07x16,Unknown,"I was all, ""Do I look like I'm from Ronkonkoma?!"""
07x16,Unknown,All
07x16,,Oh...!
07x16,Unknown,That's all you gotta say!
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, oh, oh, big man with a briefcase!"
07x16,Unknown,"What do you think, you're better than me?!"
07x16,Unknown,(all laughing)
07x16,Unknown,"Hey, our stop's next."
07x16,Unknown,Do you want to join us?
07x16,Unknown,"Yeah, I think we do. Nah, we're good."
07x16,Unknown,Too skanky.
07x16,Unknown,Too skanky? Eh...
07x16,Unknown,It's the Drunk Train.
07x16,Unknown,"You crossed out all the stops and wrote ""Vaginaville."""
07x16,Unknown,That's not true.
07x16,Unknown,"That one says ""Boner Gardens."""
07x16,Unknown,(snickers)
07x16,Unknown,What's going on?
07x16,Unknown,Wait. Did that Quinn girl shake your game or something?
07x16,Unknown,Hell no!
07x16,Unknown,At the end of the night...
07x16,Unknown,"You know, I went out tonight looking for a cheap, meaningless fling."
07x16,Unknown,But you turned out to be so special.
07x16,Unknown,I'd hate to ruin this friendship with sex.
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, oh, I am willing to take that risk."
07x16,Unknown,"Good one, Ted."
07x16,Unknown,"Anyway, I'm seriously contemplating purchasing a new ironing board."
07x16,Unknown,Do you think...?
07x16,"Okay, I'll give you this","You stood by your boy all night, even though you have no chance of getting with me."
07x16,Unknown,That was pretty cool.
07x16,Unknown,"Yeah, you know, in retrospect, I think that was the moment you decided to come back to my place and get nasty."
07x16,Unknown,"(laughs) Yeah, right."
07x16,Unknown,Get up. You're on my bra.
07x16,Unknown,Sorry.
07x16,Unknown,(grunts)
07x16,Unknown,Where's your bathroom?
07x16,Unknown,"Past the kitchen, down the hall."
07x16,Unknown,"See, I feel like I would remember you two being naked on your couch in the middle of the club."
07x16,Unknown,"Oh, right. That was later in my apartment after we got nasty."
07x16,Unknown,My bad.
07x16,Unknown,"So, you want to go to a diner or something?"
07x16,Unknown,Wait-wait-wait. You slept with her?
07x16,Unknown,"I know, I know."
07x16,Unknown,I'm late on sending the pictures.
07x16,Unknown,I've been swamped.
07x16,Unknown,You like Quinn. I...
07x16,Unknown,"That's why you can't stop ""complaining"" about her."
07x16,Unknown,That's why you just tanked our chance with these... lovely innocent flowers.
07x16,Unknown,"I don't even care where we go, but I hate doing it on the ground."
07x16,Unknown,"Barney, do you know why I'm on the Drunk Train on Valentine's Day?"
07x16,Unknown,Because I have nothing better to do.
07x16,Unknown,No one I can't stop thinking about.
07x16,Unknown,"So if you feel something for Quinn, go for it."
07x16,Unknown,Because you're wasting your time here.
07x16,Unknown,We both are.
07x16,Unknown,I don't like Quinn!
07x16,Unknown,"Kevin, I love you, but please don't just be the nice guy who says the right thing."
07x16,Unknown,"Robin, I want to marry you no matter what."
07x16,Unknown,Assuming you don't turn into a big fat fattie.
07x16,Unknown,See? Right there.
07x16,Unknown,Don't always say the right thing.
07x16,Unknown,"Look, you just got a truckload of new information dumped on you."
07x16,Unknown,Will you marry me?
07x16,Unknown,My feelings on kids aren't gonna change.
07x16,Unknown,Will you marry me?
07x16,Unknown,Haven't you always wanted kids?
07x16,Unknown,That was before I fell in love with you.
07x16,Unknown,"Well, that's the thing."
07x16,Unknown,Your future always had kids in it.
07x16,Unknown,That is something huge you would be giving up for me.
07x16,Unknown,I just don't think I could ever owe someone that much.
07x16,Unknown,"I'm scared that you'll... wake up in-in a year or ten or 50, full of regret."
07x16,Unknown,"So... I need you to be sure, okay?"
07x16,Unknown,"If we get married, you will never have children."
07x16,Unknown,Are you really okay with that?
07x16,Unknown,Enormous Penis Syndrome?
07x16,Unknown,E.P.S.
07x16,Unknown,It's all about awareness.
07x16,Unknown,"That's why we're doing the fun run, the silent auction, the three-legged race."
07x16,Unknown,"Of course, that's just one guy."
07x16,Unknown,You know what?
07x16,Unknown,I can't do this.
07x16,Unknown,You can let me out up here.
07x16,Unknown,Why? You got a girlfriend or something?
07x16,Unknown,Maybe something.
07x16,Unknown,Narrator
07x16,Unknown,"Kids, sometimes you realize"
07x16,Unknown,the journey you've been taking
07x16,Unknown,has reached its final stop.
07x16,"So, the question becomes",Where do you go next?
07x16,Unknown,Hey.
07x16,Unknown,Are you okay?
07x16,Unknown,"♪ A year from now, we'll all be gone ♪"
07x16,Unknown,♪ All our friends will move away ♪
07x16,Unknown,♪ And they're going to better places ♪

07x16,Unknown,And I-I... I-I know it's for the best.
07x16,Unknown,It's just...
07x16,Unknown,I was finally ready for something serious.
07x16,Unknown,He seemed like the guy to take that next step with.
07x16,Unknown,But he couldn't look past this.
07x16,Unknown,"I mean, who could?"
07x16,Unknown,(sighs)
07x16,Unknown,I could.
07x16,Unknown,"I love you, Robin."
07x16,Unknown,"You've been complaining about this Barney guy so much, I'm starting to think that you like him."
07x16,Unknown,Like his apartment-- check.
07x16,Unknown,Like his moves downtown--
07x16,Unknown,check plus.
07x16,Unknown,But like him? Ugh. Please.
07x16,Unknown,I'm just surprised he doesn't recognize you.
07x16,Unknown,He practically lives here.

07x17,Unknown,It was a rainy day in New York.
07x17,Unknown,We just had a horrible lunch.
07x17,Unknown,"The movie we wanted to see was sold out, and I just looked at her and said, ""I love you."""
07x17,Unknown,It was a big deal for me.
07x17,Unknown,I hadn't said that to a girl since...
07x17,Unknown,"I love you, Robin."
07x17,Unknown,I'm serious.
07x17,Unknown,Do you remember why we broke up in the first place?
07x17,Unknown,"We asked each other, ""Where do you want"
07x17,Unknown,"to be in five years?"""
07x17,Unknown,And our answers were just too different.
07x17,Unknown,"Well, it's five years later, and where are we?"
07x17,Unknown,Standing on the roof
07x17,Unknown,where I kissed you for the first time.
07x17,Unknown,"I know this is a lot to process, so no pressure here."
07x17,Unknown,Just... what do you think?
07x17,Unknown,"You know what? You're exhausted, it's late."
07x17,Unknown,Let's just go to sleep.
07x17,Unknown,"Well, good night."
07x17,Unknown,What the hell was that?
07x17,Unknown,"Okay, I can fix this."
07x17,Unknown,I-I was just temporarily insane
07x17,Unknown,"because of my Lyme disease, which I got on a camping trip that I didn't tell her about because... I go camping in secret."
07x17,Unknown,Perfect.
07x17,Unknown,"Or I could say, ""I'm sorry, we're great as friends."
07x17,Unknown,"Let's just forget I ever said anything."""
07x17,Unknown,"Yeah, that's probably better."
07x17,Unknown,"Okay, here goes."
07x17,Unknown,(sighs)
07x17,Unknown,I go camping in secret.

07x17,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, Aunt Robin was thrilled World Wide News asked her to go to Moscow to cover Maslenitsa."
07x17,Unknown,She was less thrilled to discover Maslenitsa is the city's annual butter festival.
07x17,Unknown,"Even worse, she'd spend an entire week with all those buttery Russians and her archenemy Patrice."
07x17,"Uh, our flight leaves at 9","00 p.m., not a.m."
07x17,Unknown,God... Patrice!
07x17,"But, Robin, the schedule says 9",00 a.m. and my ticket says 9:00 a.m. and all the e-mail reminders said 9:00 a.m. and our boss in the car downstairs said...

07x17,Unknown,Good-bye. Bye.
07x17,Unknown,Why didn't I kiss her?
07x17,Unknown,We'll continue this when I get back.

07x17,Unknown,Hello.
07x17,Unknown,"I know it's early, but can you meet me at the bar right now, alone?"
07x17,Unknown,I'm on my way.
07x17,Unknown,I got to meet Ted at the bar.
07x17,It's 7,00 a.m.
07x17,Unknown,"Man, Ted really needs to work on his boundaries."
07x17,Unknown,"Shh, guys, seriously."

07x17,Unknown,Why are you in our bed?
07x17,Unknown,I took the drunk train and got stuck out here.
07x17,Unknown,"Oh, God, I am so hungover."
07x17,Unknown,"Oh, God, Lily's not wearing a bra!"
07x17,Unknown,Shh!
07x17,Unknown,"Bye, baby."
07x17,Unknown,Do you think...?
07x17,Unknown,"Okay, I already know I don't want to hear this."
07x17,Unknown,Do you think that if we did it...
07x17,Unknown,"Yeah, I was right. I don't want to hear this."
07x17,Unknown,...and I did a really good job...
07x17,Unknown,Please leave.
07x17,Unknown,...that I could turn that into my baby?
07x17,Unknown,I think I'm gonna throw up.
07x17,Unknown,Morning sickness? No.
07x17,Unknown,"It's crazy, right?"
07x17,Unknown,Are you shocked?
07x17,Unknown,"No, I'm not shocked. You're in love with Robin."
07x17,Unknown,"Do you remember back at Christmas when she was upset, you didn't even know why,"
07x17,Unknown,and you spent eight hours setting up Christmas lights in the apartment just to cheer her up.
07x17,Unknown,That was a platonic friend thing. A platonic friend thing?
07x17,Unknown,"Really? Ted, let me ask you a question."
07x17,Unknown,Would you have done that for me?
07x17,Unknown,"You probably would have. You're such a good friend, Ted."
07x17,Unknown,"You, too, buddy."
07x17,Unknown,I'm going into the city.
07x17,Unknown,"Just, while I'm gone, don't go snooping around in our stuff."
07x17,Unknown,"I know you think we have a sex tape hidden somewhere, so I'll save you the trouble. We don't. Good-bye."
07x17,Unknown,Here's that moment from Barney's perspective.
07x17,Unknown,(garbled voice)
07x17,Unknown,We have a sex tape hidden somewhere.
07x17,Unknown,(garbled voice)
07x17,Unknown,Challenge accepted.
07x17,Unknown,Robin again?
07x17,Unknown,Why does everyone keep going after Robin?
07x17,Unknown,How come no one ever takes a run at me?
07x17,Unknown,Barney hits on you every day.
07x17,Unknown,"Yeah, but he just wants to bang me."
07x17,Unknown,I want something real.
07x17,Unknown,"I know, babe."
07x17,(over phone),Double A Cleaning.
07x17,Unknown,"Consuela, it's Barney."
07x17,Unknown,I need you and the girls for the afternoon.
07x17,Unknown,"Of course, right away, Mr. Barney."
07x17,Unknown,Are you at home now?
07x17,Unknown,"No, I'm at a house on Long Island."
07x17,Unknown,I'll text you the details.
07x17,Unknown,It's a big job. The place has been ransacked.
07x17,Unknown,We'll get right on it.
07x17,Unknown,"Thanks, Consuela, you're the best."
07x17,Unknown,"Ted, I know you're ready to go with this whole you-and-Robin thing, but is she ready to go?"
07x17,Unknown,Is she ready to go? Um...
07x17,(sultry),"Mmm, we'll continue this... when I get back."
07x17,Unknown,So...
07x17,Unknown,Are you sure that it wasn't...?
07x17,Unknown,We'll continue this when I get back.
07x17,Unknown,Okay.
07x17,Unknown,What?! No!
07x17,Unknown,"Damn it, Lily, why are you rooting against me?"
07x17,Unknown,I'm not rooting against you.
07x17,Unknown,"Yes, you are."
07x17,Unknown,"No, I'm not."
07x17,Unknown,"Yes, she was."
07x17,Unknown,"You see, at that very moment... ""Long-term bets""?"
07x17,Unknown,(reading)
07x17,Unknown,Hmm.
07x17,Unknown,My God! They're placing bets on our lives.
07x17,Unknown,"And I'm sorry, Ted cannot pull off bald."
07x17,Unknown,You know Ted. I'm right about this.
07x17,Unknown,(laughs)
07x17,Unknown,"Ted, I'm your best friend. Why would I root against you?"
07x17,Unknown,Lily bets Marshall that Ted and Robin won't end up together.
07x17,Unknown,Narrator
07x17,Unknown,That's why.
07x17,Unknown,Narrator
07x17,Unknown,"So, Lily was betting against me and Robin."
07x17,Unknown,I just didn't know it.
07x17,Unknown,"Okay, you want to make it work with Robin?"
07x17,Unknown,You need to stay on her radar.
07x17,Unknown,Call her right now.
07x17,Unknown,She's on the plane. Her phone's off.
07x17,Unknown,(gasps)
07x17,Unknown,"Oh, my God!"
07x17,Unknown,"How adorable would it be if when the plane lands, she turns on her phone and her mailbox is full of messages from you?!"
07x17,Unknown,(squeals)
07x17,Unknown,"Ted, don't leave her any voice mails."
07x17,Unknown,Why not?
07x17,Unknown,Because... Because you need to go to Russia.
07x17,Unknown,(gasps)
07x17,Unknown,With love!
07x17,Unknown,Surprise her.
07x17,Unknown,Make the--
07x17,Unknown,in no way creepy--
07x17,Unknown,grand romantic gesture that we all know Robin loves.
07x17,Unknown,Oh!
07x17,Unknown,So I just walk up to her in Red Square with a dozen roses?
07x17,Unknown,Or float down to her in my hot air balloon with ten dozen roses!
07x17,Unknown,"Yes, that's perfect!"
07x17,Unknown,"Not like this, Lily."
07x17,Unknown,Not like this.
07x17,Unknown,"If you'll excuse me, I've got some sonnets to write."
07x17,Unknown,"Stay put, Ted. You're gonna want to hear this."
07x17,Unknown,"Guys, what's this?"
07x17,Unknown,Narrator
07x17,Unknown,And Marshall and Lily explained.
07x17,Unknown,It all started ten years earlier.
07x17,Unknown,They had been looking for a new hobby they could do as a couple.
07x17,Unknown,I already missed the beginner's lesson.
07x17,Unknown,Maybe I shouldn't even go.
07x17,Unknown,"Ah, screw it."
07x17,Unknown,I've seen the Olympics. I know what I'm doing.
07x17,Unknown,"I'm going skiing, b*tches!"
07x17,Unknown,(loud crashing)
07x17,Unknown,He's gonna break his leg.
07x17,Unknown,He's not gonna break his leg.
07x17,Unknown,"20 bucks says he does. ""Lily bets Marshall that Ted will break his leg skiing."""
07x17,Unknown,You would be amazed.
07x17,Unknown,People fall off ski lifts all the time.
07x17,Unknown,"Well, I gotta hit the head."
07x17,Unknown,(grunts)
07x17,Unknown,"Well, he didn't break his leg."
07x17,Unknown,"Yeah, I gotta say that, um, making money off this bet just makes me feel..."
07x17,Unknown,More alive than you've felt in years?
07x17,Unknown,Yes! New hobby!
07x17,Unknown,(both yelling)
07x17,Unknown,"We need a cash box, some glitter and some glue!"
07x17,Unknown,You've been betting on us?
07x17,Unknown,Like we're a couple of hobos fighting over a sandwich in some psycho preppy kid's backyard?
07x17,Unknown,"No, this is just what happens in marriage."
07x17,Unknown,You get bored.
07x17,Unknown,You run out of things to do.
07x17,Unknown,We were making models.
07x17,Unknown,You single people are out there with the drinking and the sleeping around...
07x17,Unknown,Model airplanes.
07x17,Unknown,The grinding and the bumping and the hot sweaty bodies.
07x17,Unknown,...with little propellers that spin.
07x17,Unknown,"Oh, this one looks interesting."
07x17,Unknown,"Lily, I thought you said you wanted to."
07x17,Unknown,It was your idea.
07x17,Unknown,I starved myself for a week to get camera-ready.
07x17,Unknown,You had a bear claw for breakfast.
07x17,Unknown,"Yeah,"
07x17,Unknown,a
07x17,Unknown,bear claw.
07x17,Unknown,I-I changed my mind.
07x17,Unknown,I-I just don't want Barney to see us doing it.
07x17,Unknown,Barney is never gonna see this.
07x17,Unknown,"Oh, come on. It's Barney."
07x17,Unknown,"Eventually, somehow he's gonna see it."
07x17,Unknown,Want to bet?
07x17,Unknown,So there really is a sex tape.
07x17,Unknown,"Anyhoozles, just... long-term bets, just a silly thing we do."
07x17,Unknown,"What about you, Ted?"
07x17,Unknown,"Your hair's looking good. ""Lily bets Marshall that Ted and Robin won't end up together."""
07x17,Unknown,Wow.
07x17,Unknown,So now it's becoming clear why... you've been trying to sabotage my future happiness.
07x17,Unknown,To win a bet.
07x17,Unknown,"Come on, Ted."
07x17,Unknown,We made that bet so long ago.
07x17,Unknown,"And boy, it's been a real nail-biter."
07x17,Unknown,Ted and Stella got engaged.
07x17,Unknown,Pay up.
07x17,Unknown,Not yet.
07x17,Unknown,We are driving to the wedding.
07x17,Unknown,Pay up.
07x17,Unknown,Not yet.
07x17,Unknown,We are at the wedding.
07x17,Unknown,Pay up.
07x17,Unknown,Not yet.
07x17,Unknown,Damn it.
07x17,Unknown,I can't believe you guys!
07x17,Unknown,"I got left at the alter, and all you cared about was some stupid bet?"
07x17,Unknown,"I never stopped rooting for you, but I..."
07x17,Unknown,"Ted, I'm not rooting against you."
07x17,Unknown,I just don't think Robin's the girl you marry.
07x17,Unknown,That's why I made the stupid bet to begin with.
07x17,Unknown,"I mean, yes, it's five years later, and you haven't settled down with anyone else, but you haven't settled down with Robin, either."
07x17,Unknown,There must be a reason for that.
07x17,Unknown,What's standing in the way?
07x17,Unknown,(frustrated muttering)
07x17,Unknown,"God... if you help me find this sex tape, I am going to make some changes in my life."
07x17,Unknown,"I am going to stop sleeping around, quit drinking so much, no more shenanigans."
07x17,Unknown,"I am going to devote my entire life to doing good deeds, and praising your name."
07x17,Unknown,"Is this what you're looking for, Mr. Barney?"
07x17,Unknown,"Never mind, bro. Found it."
07x17,Unknown,I found it!
07x17,Unknown,"Sweet glory hallelujah, I found it, Ted."
07x17,Unknown,"You're the only idiot I know who still owns a VCR, so you are the lucky winner of the ""Who gets to sit next to me and watch our best friends go bananas all over each other"""" sweepstakes."
07x17,Unknown,To the outdated viewing device!
07x17,Unknown,Narrator
07x17,Unknown,And then I realized why Robin and I hadn't gotten back together in the last five years.
07x17,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
07x17,Unknown,Robin's in love with you.
07x17,Unknown,I can't believe I didn't see it before.
07x17,Unknown,Robin is in love with you.
07x17,Unknown,"No, she's not. Trust me."
07x17,Unknown,"Yes, she is."
07x17,Unknown,Something happened between you guys.
07x17,Unknown,That's why you broke up with Nora.
07x17,Unknown,"That night, I saw you in her room, there were rose petals, candles..."
07x17,Unknown,You saw that?
07x17,Unknown,"Well, then, maybe you also saw those rose petals and candles going into a garbage bag."
07x17,Unknown,Narrator
07x17,Unknown,And then Barney told me everything.
07x17,Unknown,How he and Robin hooked up.
07x17,Unknown,How he broke up with Nora to be with her.
07x17,Unknown,How he thought she would do the same for him.
07x17,Unknown,How she broke his heart.
07x17,Unknown,She chose Kevin.
07x17,Unknown,"It hurt, but..."
07x17,Unknown,I guess they're in love.
07x17,Unknown,They broke up last night.
07x17,Unknown,Bummer.
07x17,Unknown,"Anyway, let's make our own bets about this sex tape."
07x17,Unknown,"I've got Marshall with a surprise piercing at five-to-one odds, Lily with a landing strip, ten-to-one, Marshall with a landing strip, even money."
07x17,Unknown,I don't believe this.
07x17,Unknown,"You were in love with Robin, you find out she's single, and your reaction is ""Bummer""?"
07x17,Unknown,"What do you want me to say, Ted?"
07x17,Unknown,"Whatever I thought was there, she thought differently."
07x17,Unknown,"So... no, I don't care that Robin is single again."
07x17,Unknown,"So if Robin started dating someone else, you wouldn't mind?"
07x17,Unknown,Nope.
07x17,Unknown,Even if that somebody else was me?
07x17,Unknown,Even if that somebody else was you.
07x17,Unknown,Really? Really.
07x17,Unknown,"Hey, bros before hos, right?"
07x17,Unknown,"No matter how mad she made me, Robin's still my bro."
07x17,Unknown,"And if, uh, you make her happy, then that makes me happy."
07x17,Unknown,"Barney, you've really grown up, you know that?"
07x17,Unknown,Thanks.
07x17,Unknown,Now let's watch our two best friends have sex on tape.
07x17,Unknown,I'll make the popcorn.
07x17,Unknown,(Barney giggles)
07x17,Unknown,Don't watch that tape!
07x17,Unknown,Watch that tape!
07x17,Unknown,"Well, sorry, I just really want to win the bet."
07x17,Unknown,And here we go.
07x17,Unknown,"O-okay. Okay, fine, Barney."
07x17,Unknown,"Watch our dirty little home movie, but be forewarned, at about the one minute mark, you're going to see me make this face."
07x17,Unknown,"Oh, God, that's the face you made the day we rode motorcycles. Yeah."
07x17,Unknown,Yeah. You really want to see that?
07x17,Unknown,"A-and do you want to hear me go, uh..."
07x17,Unknown,(bleating grunts)
07x17,Unknown,(gags)
07x17,Unknown,(bleating grunting)
07x17,Unknown,It can't sound like that. It can't.
07x17,Unknown,"I know that noise, I've heard it through the walls."
07x17,Unknown,I thought the neighbors had a sick cat.
07x17,"Okay, but, Barney, just remember, you'll also be seeing a lot of this","Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
07x17,Unknown,"It's this, but I'm not pregnant."
07x17,Unknown,"My skin is loose, like an elephant."
07x17,Unknown,My boobs are perky and plump.
07x17,Unknown,I slobber like a confused old dog.
07x17,Unknown,I slap my own ass. I slap my own ass!
07x17,Unknown,(yells)
07x17,Unknown,Barney... that was
07x17,Unknown,my
07x17,Unknown,VCR.
07x17,Unknown,Ted... it was a VCR.
07x17,Unknown,"A week later, I picked Robin up"
07x17,Unknown,at the airport.
07x17,Unknown,♪
07x17,Unknown,♪
07x17,Unknown,And took her out to dinner at her favorite restaurant.
07x17,Unknown,"It's not going to happen, is it?"
07x17,Unknown,(sighs)
07x17,Unknown,I'm sorry.
07x17,Unknown,It's because of Barney.
07x17,Unknown,What?
07x17,Unknown,No.
07x17,Unknown,Barney and I... we...
07x17,Unknown,No. No. It's just...
07x17,Unknown,"You know, things have just been so crazy lately."
07x17,Unknown,Everything in my life is... unstable.
07x17,Unknown,"I mean, you're one of the few things that I can count on."
07x17,Unknown,And... I really don't want to mess that up.
07x17,Unknown,"We-we... we still have our deal, right?"
07x17,Unknown,If we're both still... single when we're 40?
07x17,Unknown,Yeah. Yeah.
07x17,Unknown,No. Look... I'm sorry.
07x17,Unknown,I-I can't do that anymore.
07x17,Unknown,"As long as the door is even a little bit open, I have this feeling that I'll just be... waiting around to see if I win the lottery when you turn 40."
07x17,Unknown,"I think you know how you feel about me now, and... I don't think time's going to change that."
07x17,Unknown,Just tell me.
07x17,Unknown,Do you love me?
07x17,Unknown,No.
07x17,Unknown,(sighs)
07x17,Unknown,I'm sorry.
07x17,Unknown,We're great as friends.
07x17,Unknown,Let's just...
07x17,Unknown,(clears throat)
07x17,Unknown,Let's just forget I ever said anything.
07x17,Unknown,(sighs)
07x17,Unknown,Bar. Alone. Now.
07x17,Unknown,It's just a bump in the road.
07x17,Unknown,You guys are meant to be together.
07x17,Unknown,You can't give up.
07x17,Unknown,You... i-it can still happen.
07x17,Unknown,No. Marshall...
07x17,Unknown,"What about the hot air balloon thing, with the ten dozen roses?"
07x17,Unknown,"And how's the sonnet coming, buddy? Dude."
07x17,Unknown,You bet on the wrong horse. Let it go.
07x17,Unknown,"Believe it or not, I'm happy about this. I'm..."
07x17,Unknown,I can finally move on.
07x17,Unknown,This is a good thing.
07x17,Unknown,Really.
07x17,Unknown,"Hey, Robin."
07x17,Unknown,"Oh, hey. Hey."
07x17,Unknown,"Hey. Uh, look, before I forget, here's Lily's hairdryer."
07x17,Unknown,"I borrowed it, like, a million years ago."
07x17,Unknown,"Yeah, you can keep that."
07x17,Unknown,"Um... Hey, listen, Ted told me what happened with you guys, and he says that he's at peace with it."
07x17,Unknown,"Oh, really?"

07x17,Here's the funny thing,"In my own crazy way, I was kind of happy."
07x17,Unknown,"For the first time in years, there was no little part of me clinging to the dream of being with Robin."
07x17,Unknown,"Which meant, for the first time in years, the world was wide open."
07x17,Unknown,"Because, kids... when a door closes, well..."

07x18,Unknown,"Kids, 2012 started out kind of crazy."
07x18,Unknown,"Barney met a girl named Quinn,"
07x18,Unknown,"Kevin unproposed to Robin, I told Robin..."
07x18,Unknown,"I love you, Robin."
07x18,Unknown,"When I asked if she loved me back, she said..."
07x18,Unknown,No.
07x18,Unknown,Marshall told Robin...
07x18,Unknown,You got to move out.
07x18,Unknown,And Robin did.
07x18,Unknown,I can't even open her bedroom door anymore.
07x18,Unknown,Why do I have to be so sensitive?
07x18,Unknown,"I don't know, bro."
07x18,Unknown,Look at me and that Quinn chick.
07x18,Unknown,"You don't hear me prattling on about how beautiful her smile is, how her hair is like a waterfall of honey-colored silk, how her eyes are like a warm South Sea kissed by the fire and gold of sunrise."
07x18,Unknown,I don't even remember what she looks like.
07x18,Unknown,"Dude, you obviously like her. Can't you read between the lines, Ted?"
07x18,Unknown,I obviously like her.
07x18,Unknown,How did this happen to me?
07x18,Unknown,When did I become such a gooey romantic?
07x18,Unknown,"Look, I think it's healthy that you have real feelings for a woman instead of just seeing her as an object."
07x18,Unknown,Switch?
07x18,Unknown,Sure.
07x18,Unknown,(snaps fingers)
07x18,Unknown,But why Quinn?
07x18,Unknown,"I mean, you spent one night with her, and she was kind of mean."
07x18,Unknown,We just connected.
07x18,Unknown,"Emotionally, intellectually, spiritually."
07x18,Unknown,"So, mind-blowing sex?"
07x18,Unknown,Mind-blowing sex!
07x18,Unknown,"For an hour afterwards, I couldn't uncross my eyes."
07x18,Unknown,"Which was awesome, because when I went back for seconds, I would if I knew how to get in touch with her, but I can't, and it's driving me crazy."
07x18,Unknown,"Everywhere I look, I see her."
07x18,Unknown,I see her walking on the street; I see her shopping in the store; I see her dancing on that pole.
07x18,Unknown,"I see her dancing on that pole, too."
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, my God, that's Quinn."

07x18,Unknown,"Well, you shouldn't have come to East Meadow, Long Island, Robin, if you didn't want to be entertained."
07x18,Unknown,Really? I didn't think there was a ton to do here.
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, apparently, someone hasn't heard of the Uniondale Miniatures Museum."

07x18,Unknown,"When Robin moved out, there was a hole in my life in the shape of an empty bedroom."
07x18,Unknown,I filled it with a new hobby.

07x18,Unknown,(coughing)
07x18,Unknown,What are you doing in my old room?
07x18,Unknown,"This room being empty was bumming me out, so I decided to do something healthy that would take my mind off you."
07x18,Unknown,"Well, nothing says healthy like smoking 40 pounds of pork loin in an unventilated room while having an imaginary conversation with your ex."
07x18,Unknown,"Just for that, you're not getting any."
07x18,Unknown,I'm not getting any?
07x18,Unknown,You're the one smoking your own meat.
07x18,Unknown,Oh!
07x18,Unknown,(knocking)
07x18,Unknown,What am I gonna do about this Quinn thing?
07x18,Unknown,"I want to ask her out again, but I don't know how I feel about her being a stripper."
07x18,Unknown,Why would you have an issue with that?
07x18,Unknown,"I mean, you've dated convicted felons, arms dealers... pageant moms."
07x18,Unknown,"Hey, Quinn is someone I might want to get serious with, not just pretend to be a judge"
07x18,Unknown,(chuckles) Tiffany's mom
07x18,Unknown,really
07x18,Unknown,wanted that tiara.
07x18,Unknown,"In a city of eight million people, you happened to walk into the club where she works?"
07x18,Unknown,Maybe it's destiny.
07x18,Unknown,"No, Destiny strips at The Melon Patch."
07x18,Unknown,"They're people, Ted; try to keep them straight."
07x18,Unknown,Wait a minute.
07x18,Unknown,What if this is destiny?
07x18,Unknown,I just said...
07x18,Unknown,What if the universe is throwing us in each other's path for some reason?
07x18,Unknown,More or less exactly what I...
07x18,Unknown,"I don't care what you say, this is destiny!"
07x18,Unknown,"Damn it, Ted!"
07x18,Unknown,Why can't you ever root for love?
07x18,Unknown,Hey.
07x18,Unknown,Hey.
07x18,Unknown,Quinn...
07x18,Unknown,"No, listen, in here I'm Karma, okay?"
07x18,Unknown,Got it.
07x18,Unknown,"Uh, look, Karma, I swear I never say crap like this, but..."
07x18,Unknown,I think maybe the universe is telling us something.
07x18,Unknown,You want to go out again?
07x18,Unknown,"I'm sorry, I don't date customers."
07x18,Unknown,What about destiny?
07x18,Unknown,I heard she's over at The Melon Patch now.
07x18,Unknown,"No, I mean like fate telling us that we're supposed to be..."
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, listen, Barney, my manager is really giving me the stink eye."
07x18,Unknown,I have to get back to work.
07x18,Unknown,"Okay, wait, wait."
07x18,Unknown,What if I pay for a dance?
07x18,Unknown,"That way, your manager's happy, and then I can to tell you why you should go on another date with me."
07x18,Unknown,I guess there's no reason why not.
07x18,Unknown,"Okay, first off, we have a lot in common."
07x18,Unknown,"For example, both of our jobs are largely financed by drunk Asian businessmen."
07x18,Unknown,Dear Diary.
07x18,Unknown,"It is day four on this island,"
07x18,Unknown,"which the natives have dubbed ""Long Island,"" perhaps referencing how each hour here feels like it may never end."
07x18,Unknown,"So far, they have welcomed me and given me a rare glimpse into their bizarre way of life."
07x18,Unknown,"By ""entertainment,"" they mean table shuffle board, macramé classes, and other non-stimulating activities which are only used in Manhattan to calm down drug addicts and the criminally insane."
07x18,Unknown,"A preliterate society, their menus display pictures of the food they offer, everyone is forced to sing ""Happy Birthday"" four or five times a meal, and dessert has fireworks in it."
07x18,Unknown,"In their lairs, they often don"
07x18,Unknown,"a primitive shroud called a ""Snugget,"" and it is not uncommon for them to go to sleep before 9 p.m., fearing, as they do, the night."
07x18,Unknown,"Also Diary, I think writing in you is stupid,"
07x18,Unknown,"but you were a gift from Lily,"
07x18,Unknown,and she's watching me right now.
07x18,Unknown,"Guys, um, I don't want to overstay my welcome, and Patrice said that she would take me off your hands."
07x18,Unknown,"So, do you have a train schedule or..."
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, um, but-but there's a-a problem with the train."
07x18,Unknown,"Big, big problem."
07x18,Unknown,There was a...
07x18,Unknown,Strike. A lightning strike.
07x18,Unknown,That hit one of the picketers who was on strike.
07x18,Unknown,During a thunderstorm.
07x18,Unknown,"Plus, you don't want to be a burden on Patrice."
07x18,Unknown,"Yeah, she probably doesn't even want you there."
07x18,Unknown,You guys are being weird.
07x18,Unknown,Oh! Oh!
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, my God, Robin, I am so sorry."
07x18,Unknown,I'll throw these in the wash.
07x18,Unknown,They'll be dry and folded in the morning.
07x18,Unknown,Or the weekend.
07x18,Unknown,And we can talk about you leaving then.
07x18,(quietly),Or never.
07x18,Unknown,"Wait, Lily, why don't..."
07x18,Unknown,(yawns loudly)
07x18,It's 8,"45, time to hit the hay."
07x18,Unknown,Lily
07x18,,Good night!
07x18,Unknown,(lock clicks)
07x18,Unknown,"So Ted, what healthy, not-at-all-crazy activity are you up to now?"
07x18,"I liked smoking meat, but now I've got a new passion",wood.
07x18,Unknown,"You hear these things that come out of your mouth, right?"
07x18,Unknown,(knocking)
07x18,Unknown,So I went back to the Lusty Leopard.
07x18,Unknown,"You know what, Barney?"
07x18,Unknown,"I know I said I have a rule about not dating customers, but you may have convinced me to..."
07x18,Unknown,(music stops)
07x18,Unknown,Oh.
07x18,Unknown,"Song's over, I got to go."
07x18,Unknown,"Wait, no, what? Convinced you to what?"
07x18,Unknown,"I'm sorry, but manager's giving me the stink eye."
07x18,Unknown,"Ugh, get a life, Manager."
07x18,Unknown,What were you saying?
07x18,Unknown,"Well, I was going to say that I do find you very... charming."
07x18,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x18,Unknown,And funny... and sexy.
07x18,Unknown,And exciting and smart.
07x18,Unknown,You so get me.
07x18,Unknown,"You know what, Barney?"
07x18,Unknown,"I have never done this before, but there's just something about you."
07x18,Unknown,So I guess my answer is...
07x18,Unknown,(music stops)
07x18,Unknown,(gasps) Oh.
07x18,Unknown,The song's over.
07x18,Unknown,"Well, just finish the thought!"
07x18,Unknown,"But the manager. God, I hate manager."
07x18,Unknown,(snoring)
07x18,Unknown,There. Your answer is...
07x18,Unknown,Maybe if we knew each other a little better.
07x18,Unknown,(sighs)
07x18,Unknown,Tell me about yourself.
07x18,Unknown,"Well, um, what can I tell you?"
07x18,Unknown,"I'm, um... charming and funny and sexy and... exciting and smart."
07x18,Unknown,"Well, how can a girl say no to that?"
07x18,Unknown,How about we... go out on... aaaaaaaaa... aaaaaa...
07x18,Unknown,"Ugh, these songs are so short."
07x18,Unknown,(groans)
07x18,Unknown,"Uh, how much exactly did you give Quinn?"
07x18,Unknown,"Eight, nine hundred bucks, plus whatever my Rolex is worth."
07x18,Unknown,Whoa.
07x18,Unknown,I know.
07x18,Unknown,"Ted, I think I'm in love."
07x18,Unknown,Quinn is totally playing you.
07x18,Unknown,What?
07x18,Unknown,That's ridiculous.
07x18,Unknown,"If she were playing me, why would she agree to go on a date with me?"
07x18,Unknown,You're different than the rest of these schlubs.
07x18,Unknown,"This one time only, I'm going to break my rule."
07x18,Unknown,Let's go out tomorrow night.
07x18,Unknown,Sweet!
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, sh**t! I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!"
07x18,Unknown,Hey! Brainstorm!
07x18,Unknown,"What if we just have our date here, It's a date."
07x18,Unknown,"It's not a date, if you go into a strip club and paying for lap dances."
07x18,Unknown,"If it's not a date, why'd she say, every fifth day was free?"
07x18,Unknown,"Because that's the Lusty Leopard's policy on Friday nights, and I'm so mad at you that I know that!"
07x18,Unknown,Robin
07x18,Unknown,Dear Diary.
07x18,Unknown,"It is day six on this island, and I begin to fear I am more c*ptive than guest..."
07x18,Unknown,(screams)
07x18,Unknown,"Morning, sweetie."
07x18,Unknown,Up for croquet?
07x18,Unknown,"Hey, uh, Lil, are you done washing my clothes yet? Because I..."
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, I am so sorry."
07x18,Unknown,Your clothes accidentally wound up in the bag I donated to Goodwill.
07x18,Unknown,You gave away my clothes?
07x18,Unknown,They were a bit fancy for East Meadow.
07x18,(whispers),People were staring.
07x18,Unknown,"Besides, we have an extra Snugget."
07x18,Unknown,Try it.
07x18,Unknown,"Try it, Robin."
07x18,Unknown,Robin
07x18,Unknown,"They're trying to make me one of them, Diary."
07x18,Unknown,And I begin to fear...
07x18,Unknown,I may like it!
07x18,Unknown,"I can't believe we're at a strip club, and the biggest boob in here is you."
07x18,Unknown,"It's a real date, Ted."
07x18,Unknown,And clearly you haven't seen the DeSalvo twins.
07x18,Unknown,She's right over there.
07x18,Unknown,Barney... Yowza!
07x18,Unknown,You are not on a date.
07x18,Unknown,"Okay, look, prove it."
07x18,Unknown,Prove that she's not just taking advantage of you.
07x18,Unknown,Get her to go out with you anywhere but here.
07x18,Unknown,Fine!
07x18,Unknown,"Hey, sexy! You want a dance?"
07x18,Unknown,Yeah!
07x18,Unknown,"Uh, one thing, though."
07x18,Unknown,"Um, you'd be okay with us having a date somewhere besides here, wouldn't you?"
07x18,Unknown,I was hoping you would ask that.
07x18,Unknown,"I'm sorry it's so expensive in here, but it's nice and private, huh?"
07x18,Unknown,Absolutely. And romantic!
07x18,Unknown,It's our first getaway as a couple!
07x18,Unknown,"It's become clear to me, Diary,"
07x18,Unknown,that I must attempt a dramatic escape.
07x18,Unknown,I will fake a stomach ache during dinner.
07x18,Unknown,"Then, after Marshall and Lily leave for bingo night, I will sneak out the back."
07x18,Unknown,I'll swipe Shirley's Rascal and drive to the train station.
07x18,Unknown,"Shirley's 42, by the way, and rides a Rascal."
07x18,Unknown,"I swear, it's the second half of"
07x18,Unknown,Wall-E out here.
07x18,Unknown,(two handclaps)
07x18,Unknown,Bingo... was canceled.
07x18,Unknown,"Hey, sexy, you want a dance?"
07x18,Unknown,"(chuckles) No, I'm not a customer."
07x18,Unknown,My girlfriend works here.
07x18,Unknown,She's right over...
07x18,Unknown,"This one time only, I'm gonna break my rule."
07x18,Unknown,Let's go out tomorrow night!
07x18,Unknown,Sweet!
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, sh**t!"
07x18,Unknown,I have to work tomorrow. Ugh!
07x18,Unknown,Hey! Brainstorm!
07x18,Unknown,"What if we just have our date here, maybe in the Champagne Room?"
07x18,Unknown,That was our spot.
07x18,Unknown,"Hey, gorgeous, You want a dance?"
07x18,Unknown,"Is it a jig? 'Cause if so, it's up."
07x18,Unknown,"Sorry, I only had the last verse of ""Hot For Teacher"" to work on that. What was that?"
07x18,Unknown,You laid exactly the same line on that guy that you did on me!
07x18,Unknown,"Sweetie, that is just something I say to these gullible losers here."
07x18,Unknown,They fall for it every time.
07x18,(chuckling),Bunch of losers!
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, gosh, manager again."
07x18,Unknown,"He's looking at me like, ""Karma, why aren't you booking more time in the Champagne Room?"""
07x18,Unknown,"Well, we'll show him."
07x18,Unknown,No! You're playing me again!
07x18,Unknown,And you're not even trying hard!
07x18,Unknown,There's no manager there; You're pointing at a fern!
07x18,Unknown,Ted was right.
07x18,Unknown,"I bet he's home right now, laughing at how dumb I am."
07x18,Unknown,Did I deserve this? Absolutely.
07x18,Unknown,I have told some outrageous lies.
07x18,Unknown,"I have told women I was famous, a w*r hero, that sex with me would cure their nearsightedness."
07x18,Unknown,Barney?!
07x18,Unknown,I probably deserved everything you did to me and more.
07x18,Unknown,"But I have been trying, and trying hard to be a better person."
07x18,Unknown,Thanks for showing me I had it right before.
07x18,Unknown,"Look, I'm sorry we made you feel a little suffocated, but were you really just gonna sneak away?"
07x18,Unknown,"Well, it's just... I really miss the city."
07x18,Unknown,"I know you guys love it here, and that's fine, We don't love it here!"
07x18,Unknown,What?
07x18,Unknown,"Come on, Robin, what kind of life is this?"
07x18,Unknown,Going to canasta tournaments and high school field hockey playoffs?
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, I think North Bellmore can take state."
07x18,Unknown,With Sophie's ankle? Doubtful.
07x18,Unknown,"Okay, but if you two are so unhappy, why don't you just move back to Manhattan?"
07x18,Unknown,Because the suburbs are better for the baby.
07x18,Unknown,Who says? Who says any place is better for the baby if you two are unhappy in it?
07x18,Unknown,"No, no, we live here now."
07x18,Unknown,"And, you know, this place wouldn't seem so bad if... we got one of our friends to move out here."
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, guys..."
07x18,Unknown,Oh...
07x18,Unknown,I would rather set myself on fire.
07x18,Unknown,Narrator
07x18,Unknown,"The next morning, Barney learned that even in"
07x18,Unknown,"a city of eight million people,"
07x18,Unknown,there's no escaping Karma.
07x18,Unknown,(light music playing)
07x18,Unknown,(sighs)
07x18,Unknown,Oh.
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, hey."
07x18,Unknown,"Sorry, can't talk; manager's watching."
07x18,Unknown,"Look, I am sorry if I hurt your feelings; it's a job."
07x18,Unknown,"Yeah, well, at my job, we don't rip out people's hearts for money."
07x18,Unknown,"My company briefly backed a lab in North Korea which did, but we sold it!"
07x18,Unknown,"You know, I've worked at that club for a year."
07x18,Unknown,"You practically live there, and you didn't even recognize me the night we went out."
07x18,Unknown,You can't pretend to be some hurt little victim with me.
07x18,Unknown,I know you.
07x18,Unknown,"Well, of course you do."
07x18,Unknown,I told you things I don't tell anybody.
07x18,Unknown,I was honest with you.
07x18,Unknown,"Yeah, because I believe you have a gay black brother, a friend lonely enough to smoke his own meat and that your mom was a groupie for Supertramp."
07x18,Unknown,They named their band for her!
07x18,Unknown,You remembered all that?
07x18,Unknown,"Well, yeah. I mean, you're more interesting than the lyrics to ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" for the 8,000th time."
07x18,Unknown,"You know, it's funny."
07x18,Unknown,Almost every woman I've ever met was wrong to give me a chance.
07x18,Unknown,You're the first woman who's wrong not to.
07x18,Unknown,Large black coffee... and whatever he's having.
07x18,Unknown,It's on me.
07x18,Unknown,The same.
07x18,Unknown,Thank you.
07x18,Unknown,You're welcome.
07x18,Unknown,"1,700 more of these and we're even."
07x18,Unknown,"Uh, the song just ended."
07x18,Unknown,That mean you got to get going?
07x18,Unknown,No.
07x18,Unknown,Do you have time to sit with me?
07x18,Unknown,I don't know. You're wearing my watch.
07x18,Unknown,Pottery. Now you're making pottery.
07x18,Unknown,I needed a new vase... and some plates.

07x18,Unknown,(chuckles) You mean a room ready and waiting for someone who isn't there?
07x18,Unknown,A room devoted to reminding me that I'm still alone?
07x18,Unknown,"Yeah, I don't need that."
07x18,Unknown,"Ted, no matter how many things you put in this room..."
07x18,Unknown,I'll still be here.

07x18,Unknown,Hey.
07x18,Unknown,Hey!
07x18,Unknown,Come on in.
07x18,Unknown,Thanks.
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, um, thanks for packing up the rest of my stuff."
07x18,Unknown,"No problem. Uh, you want some coffee?"
07x18,Unknown,"Uh, sure. Yeah? Yeah."
07x18,Unknown,"So, how are things?"
07x18,Unknown,Good! You? Great!
07x18,Unknown,"You know, I actually made this mug."
07x18,Unknown,"Oh, yeah? Oh! Yeah. Oh!"
07x18,Unknown,"Yeah, sorry, coffee's a little strong."
07x18,Unknown,How was your stay with Marshall and Lily?
07x18,Unknown,Uh... a little weird.
07x18,Unknown,They're not loving Long Island.
07x18,Unknown,Oh.
07x18,Unknown,"I think deep down, they realize it just... isn't a good fit."
07x18,Unknown,It's hard to admit that sometimes.
07x18,Unknown,Sure is.
07x18,Unknown,"But I guess it's better to face it and move on than try to force something that just isn't meant to be, right?"
07x18,Unknown,I think so.
07x18,Unknown,Yeah.
07x18,Unknown,"So, what do you think you're gonna do with my old room?"
07x18,Unknown,Haven't really thought about it.
07x18,Unknown,Oh!
07x18,Unknown,Who needs Manhattan?
07x18,Unknown,Yeah.
07x18,Unknown,(phone buzzes)
07x18,Unknown,"Hmm, it's Ted. He wants to know if we want to hang out in the city."
07x18,Unknown,The next train leaves in nine minutes.

07x18,Unknown,Ted
07x18,Unknown,"Dear Lily and Marshall, I don't know if you know this, but I never took your names off the lease."
07x18,Unknown,"Well, today I took my name off it."
07x18,Unknown,The apartment is now yours.
07x18,Unknown,And I think I finally figured out the best thing to do with Robin's old room.
07x18,Unknown,(soft gasp)
07x18,Unknown,"See, for me, this place has begun to feel a little haunted."
07x18,Unknown,"At first, I thought it was haunted by Robin, but now I think it was haunted by me."
07x18,Unknown,"Well, no ghost is at peace until it finally moves on."
07x18,Unknown,I need a change.
07x18,Unknown,"And I think you do, too."
07x18,Unknown,This apartment needs some new life.
07x18,Unknown,"So, please, make our old home your new home."
07x18,Unknown,It is now ghost-free.

07x19,Unknown,I was worried something bad happened...

07x19,Unknown,"We're inviting everyone to dinner at Quinn's, and I want them to keep an open mind, which brings us to The Broath."

07x19,Unknown,Barney's taking her to Hawaii.
07x19,Unknown,"Lily, you snooped through her stuff?"

07x19,Unknown,Hey.
07x19,Unknown,"You know we would've hated ourselves, right?"
07x19,Unknown,"So, did Robin tell you the incredibly devious thing she did today?"
07x19,Unknown,Me?!

07x19,Unknown,This is such a weird coincidence!

07x19,Unknown,You deserve it all.

07x19,Unknown,It happened while I was playing Peter Pan.
07x19,Unknown,Here's a photo from the day I was cast.
07x19,Unknown,That's me in the middle.
07x19,Unknown,But then I had my growth spurt.
07x19,Unknown,"By opening night, I was too big for the flying harness, and, well..."
07x19,Unknown,I fell hands-first right onto Jenna Cristalli.
07x19,Unknown,The tissues in her bra saved me two broken wrists.
07x19,Unknown,"I'm sorry. I just, I just wanted to have one cool sex story that wasn't you."
07x19,Unknown,"Okay. Next time you tell it, you were in your dad's car, which you stole to go to a Metallica concert, and you got to third base with that sl*t."
07x19,Unknown,I was once with this chick... who is just the best wife ever.
07x19,Unknown,Thank you for being so cool about what I do.
07x19,Unknown,A lot of guys would be weird or jealous.

07x19,Unknown,"Nah, I like taking my clothes off for money."
07x19,Unknown,Great.
07x19,Unknown,Let me... let me finish.
07x19,Unknown,"Hypothetically, what would make you stop?"
07x19,Unknown,Hypothetically...
07x19,Unknown,I would stop stripping if I ever got married.
07x19,Unknown,Good night.
07x19,Unknown,"And then we agreed to ""go back to normal."""
07x19,Unknown,But I'm starting to wonder if we can ever really just be friends.
07x19,Unknown,"Anyway, that's the story of me and Robin, 2005 to the present."

07x20,Unknown,"So, where do you guys think we'll be in three years?"
07x20,Unknown,It'll be 2012.
07x20,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x20,Unknown,That's an easy one.
07x20,Unknown,"Guys, this is Sophia."
07x20,Unknown,(glass shatters)
07x20,Unknown,You'll be seeing a lot more of...
07x20,Unknown,Marshall
07x20,,"Okay, that is so weird."
07x20,Unknown,I was just trying to use the force.
07x20,Unknown,"Do you think instead of making a beer fly out of the fridge, I made that lamp break?"
07x20,Unknown,Either that or the stormtrooper did.
07x20,Unknown,(laughter)
07x20,Unknown,"Oh, the stormtrooper would never do that."
07x20,Unknown,"He knows that lamp costs $1,200."
07x20,"Anyway, while it's just us guys, let me ask you something","we've all had that same fantasy about having sex with a girl in a stormtrooper costume, right?"
07x20,Unknown,"Mmm, no."
07x20,Unknown,Never.
07x20,Unknown,"Guys... come on, no girls around, just us bros."
07x20,Unknown,Safe space.
07x20,Unknown,Let's stop being polite and start gettin' real.
07x20,Unknown,Stormtrooper fantasy.
07x20,Unknown,"Every guy's had that one, right?"
07x20,Unknown,"Not even once, no. No, no, no."
07x20,Unknown,So I'm the weird one?
07x20,Unknown,Yeah. Yeah.
07x20,Unknown,Yeah.
07x20,Unknown,"How about you, Ted?"
07x20,Unknown,"How's your life gonna be different Oh, you know, the usual."
07x20,Unknown,Gonna meet a nice girl and get married.
07x20,Unknown,"I mean, I know I say that every year, but... let's be honest, in 2012, I'll be 34."
07x20,Unknown,"If it still hasn't happened for me by then,"
07x20,(laughing),something is seriously wrong with me!
07x20,Unknown,(laughter continues)
07x20,Unknown,Something is seriously wrong with me.
07x20,Unknown,I can't do this anymore.
07x20,Unknown,I can't keep smiling and being optimistic all the time when all the evidence points to the contrary.
07x20,Unknown,You really think that three years from now things aren't gonna be awesome?
07x20,Unknown,I'll tell you what things are gonna be like three years from now.
07x20,Unknown,"Uh, yes, hello. I see on my frozen entree for one they printed this number where I can voice comments and concerns."
07x20,Unknown,"Well, there's more cinnamon in the cobbler than usual."
07x20,Unknown,"No, I like cinnamon."
07x20,Unknown,"Oh, you're very welcome for my comment."
07x20,Unknown,"Wait! Uh, don't go."
07x20,Unknown,Um... do you like cinnamon?
07x20,Unknown,Hello? Hello?
07x20,Unknown,"Marshall, you want to watch"
07x20,Unknown,Star Wars?
07x20,Unknown,"No, can do, old bean!"
07x20,Unknown,"You see, we're up on the Cape living the idyllic family lifestyle that you've always dreamed of."
07x20,Unknown,"Oh, and I'm pregnant with baby #5!"
07x20,Unknown,But baby #4 isn't even out yet.
07x20,Unknown,I'm just that good!
07x20,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x20,Unknown,"Oh, oh, hold on."
07x20,Unknown,There's somebody wants to say hello to you.
07x20,Unknown,(chuckles softly)
07x20,Unknown,"Hey, Ted."
07x20,Unknown,"I just wanted to say that things are great, and I'm married to that douchey guy in the trucker hat."
07x20,Unknown,"Whassup, bra?"
07x20,Unknown,It turns out it was just
07x20,Unknown,you
07x20,Unknown,I didn't want to commit to.
07x20,Unknown,(laughter)
07x20,Unknown,"Oh, and I got back boobs."
07x20,Unknown,(giggles)
07x20,Unknown,So things are great!
07x20,Unknown,Buh-bye!

07x20,Unknown,(laughter)
07x20,Unknown,"By the way, Ted, this is Melanie."
07x20,Unknown,You'll be seeing a lot more of Melanie.
07x20,Unknown,Barney
07x20,Unknown,Wait-wait-wait a minute!
07x20,Unknown,Who is Melanie?
07x20,Unknown,"Come on, Barney, if there's one thing I can count on not to change, it's you walking in with some random girl on your arm."
07x20,Unknown,"No. No, I don't want that."
07x20,Unknown,"For the first time in my life, I don't want to find myself in three years with some random girl, no matter how many boobs she has."
07x20,Unknown,I want to be with Quinn.
07x20,Unknown,Guys... you're gonna be seeing a lot more of Quinn.
07x20,Unknown,"Dude, we've been to the Lusty Leopard. We've seen plenty."
07x20,Unknown,"I kind of walked into that one. All right, bye-bye."
07x20,Unknown,What are you doing?
07x20,Unknown,"We're living together, I'm excited about it, and I'm getting rid of my mugs."
07x20,Unknown,That was mine.
07x20,Unknown,Sorry. I don't know which are which.
07x20,Unknown,"Truth is, I never drink coffee at home."
07x20,Unknown,This one? Mm-hmm.
07x20,Unknown,There!
07x20,Unknown,I don't need my coffee mugs 'cause I got yours!
07x20,Unknown,For the rest of my life.
07x20,Unknown,Or as... long as you'll have me.
07x20,Unknown,We haven't really talked about the future.
07x20,Unknown,Did I make things awkward?
07x20,Unknown,Just keep smashing mugs.
07x20,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x20,Unknown,Or donate them.
07x20,Unknown,"Point is, I plan on being with you for a long time."
07x20,Unknown,You okay with that?
07x20,Unknown,Sounds great.
07x20,Unknown,(farts)
07x20,Unknown,Ooh.. Oh!
07x20,Unknown,I am so sorry.
07x20,Unknown,"No, no, it's great."
07x20,Unknown,A guy has to be the first one to let 'er rip.
07x20,Unknown,I was actually hoping this would happen soon.
07x20,Unknown,I've been crop-dusting the patio for weeks.
07x20,Unknown,The
07x20,Unknown,patio!
07x20,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
07x20,Unknown,"I've been going out on the street, like, exactly this time every night."
07x20,Unknown,"Where are you, blond man?!"
07x20,Unknown,Show yourself!
07x20,Unknown,I will be at my mother's.
07x20,Unknown,"We're a real couple now, aren't we?"
07x20,Unknown,We are.
07x20,Unknown,(chuckles softly)
07x20,Unknown,(both fart)
07x20,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x20,Unknown,"Hey, buddy, I get that you're bummed."
07x20,Unknown,But I got a good feeling about 2015.
07x20,Unknown,I think that's gonna be your year.
07x20,Unknown,"Kids, that was the one time I ever lost faith in the idea that my life would be better in three years."
07x20,Unknown,"And what's funny is, three years from that moment, my life was amazing."
07x20,Unknown,All right! It's trilogy time!
07x20,Unknown,Can I just lodge one complaint?
07x20,Unknown,This is a guy's tradition.
07x20,Unknown,It's kind of a lame move on Ted's part to bring a chick.
07x20,Unknown,"Come on, dude... cut him some slack."
07x20,Unknown,I know. He loves her.
07x20,And I'll give him this,she is pretty damn cute.
07x20,Unknown,Thank God she takes after her mother.
07x20,Unknown,"All right, let's watch this thing!"
07x20,Unknown,TV... play
07x20,Unknown,Star Wars
07x20,Unknown,trilogy.
07x20,Unknown,Play
07x20,Unknown,Star Wars
07x20,Unknown,tril...
07x20,Unknown,You know what? Screw it.
07x20,Unknown,"Okay, you are about to see something awesome."
07x20,And just know this,Han shot first.
07x20,Unknown,I wonder if things'll be a lot different when we watch the trilogy again in 2018.
07x20,Unknown,I hope not.
07x20,Unknown,(panting)
07x20,Unknown,"Oh, that was awesome."
07x20,Unknown,You were right-- not weird.
07x20,Unknown,No.
07x21,Unknown,"So, how's living alone?"
07x21,Unknown,"You know, it's interesting."
07x21,Unknown,"When I first moved into my new apartment,"
07x21,Unknown,I was nervous.
07x21,Unknown,"For the first time in my adult life, I didn't have a roommate."
07x21,But then it hit me,"for the first time in my adult life, I didn't have a roommate!"
07x21,Unknown,"If I want to walk around naked, nobody cares."
07x21,Unknown,"If I want to leave the laundry basket in the middle of the living room, nobody stops me."
07x21,Unknown,"If I bring home soup from the deli and leave it in the fridge for two days, nobody eats it."
07x21,Unknown,"And if I do something colossally stupid, nobody ever has to know."
07x21,Unknown,"(loud, high-pitched gasping)"
07x21,Unknown,People make fun of the guy who stays home every night doing nothing.
07x21,Unknown,But the truth is... that guy's a genius.
07x21,Unknown,"Because let's be honest, sitting around watching TV, drinking beer and eating ribs alone is what every red-blooded American would rather be doing at all times."
07x21,Unknown,"Yeah, but wouldn't it be better to have someone to share the..."
07x21,Unknown,"I mean, don't you get lonely without..."
07x21,Unknown,"Yeah, that sounds pretty great."

07x21,Unknown,Can you hold on for just one second?
07x21,Unknown,What the hell are you doing?
07x21,Unknown,Nothing.
07x21,Unknown,Did you say you had to pee?

07x21,Unknown,"I'm sorry, baby."
07x21,Unknown,Were you asleep?
07x21,Unknown,All pregnant ladies have crazy sex dreams.
07x21,Unknown,It's just her hormones going berserk.
07x21,Unknown,So who's responsible for her rapid thigh movement this time?
07x21,Unknown,"Oh, my favorite was when she banged George Washington."
07x21,Unknown,I liked the three-way with Bill Cosby and Papa Smurf.
07x21,Unknown,"Oh, he smurfed the smurf out of her."
07x21,Unknown,"Yes, while The Cos smurfed off in the corner."
07x21,Unknown,We all remember. But here's the thing.
07x21,Unknown,"When Lily has dirty dreams about other people, she always tells me."
07x21,Unknown,But this time...
07x21,Unknown,Sounds like you had a crazy dream.
07x21,Unknown,What was it about?
07x21,Unknown,And then her face turned...
07x21,Unknown,vermilion.
07x21,Unknown,"Just... you and me... gettin' it on, monogamously."
07x21,Unknown,Monoga-me-oh-my.
07x21,Unknown,"Not the rose quartz of the slightly embarrassed, or the tomato red of the mildly abashed, vermilion, the color of carnal shame."
07x21,Can only mean one thing,Lily dream-banged someone we know.
07x21,Unknown,"Okay, you caught me vermilion-handed."
07x21,Unknown,"The truth is, I've spent the last five years trying to inception your wife."
07x21,Unknown,That movie only came out two years ago.
07x21,Unknown,What movie?
07x21,Unknown,You know who I bet it is?

07x21,Unknown,"Didn't want it, did not approve it."
07x21,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x21,Unknown,It's super embarrassing.
07x21,Unknown,"Hey, Merle."
07x21,Unknown,"So, uh, do you guys want to come up and see my desk?"
07x21,Unknown,"Yeah, why not?"
07x21,Unknown,Come on.

07x21,Unknown,"You know, here I am, on national TV every day, and still a guy who spends his whole life sitting next to a giant picture of me has no idea who I am."
07x21,Unknown,This isn't my whole life; I'm in a band.
07x21,Unknown,And we're gonna make it.
07x21,Unknown,Narrator
07x21,Unknown,"And, kids, they did make it."
07x21,Unknown,But I'll get to that later.
07x21,Unknown,"You know what, I'm probably not going to get to that later."
07x21,Unknown,"They had one song, it didn't suck, the end."
07x21,Unknown,You always said it wasn't about being famous.
07x21,Unknown,"You just want to do solid journalism, right?"
07x21,Unknown,"Yeah, well..."
07x21,Unknown,Of course I want to be famous!
07x21,Unknown,"In Canada, I was Robin Sparkles."
07x21,Unknown,I was a cabinhold name.
07x21,Unknown,But here?

07x21,Unknown,Everyone knows who you are.
07x21,Unknown,You're Merle.
07x21,Unknown,He was in one skit in the Christmas party!

07x21,Unknown,Narrator
07x21,Unknown,"Kids, you remember what happened."
07x21,Unknown,"I declared my love, she turned me down, we both moved out of the apartment, and now..."
07x21,Unknown,I haven't talked to him since we... stopped talking.
07x21,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x21,Unknown,He's pretty good.
07x21,Unknown,Pretty good?
07x21,Unknown,"Last night, you ate a box of Froot Loops in your tighty whities."
07x21,Unknown,"No, I demolished a box of Froot Loops, fully nude."
07x21,Unknown,"Yeah, ""pretty good"" works."
07x21,Unknown,"Hey, Barney."
07x21,Unknown,"Hey, Lily."
07x21,Unknown,Do you know what this is about?
07x21,Unknown,Uh-huh.
07x21,Unknown,Do I want to know?
07x21,Unknown,"No, sorry, bro."
07x21,Unknown,Damn it!
07x21,Unknown,"Okay, time for my stuff."
07x21,Unknown,"Guys, I was sitting at home last night, and all of a sudden, I had a piphany."
07x21,Unknown,And my piphany was this...
07x21,Unknown,"Actually, it's, uh, it's ""epiphany."""
07x21,Unknown,"No, Ted, this is"
07x21,Unknown,the
07x21,Unknown,piphany.
07x21,And here it is,Make... every... night... legendary.
07x21,Unknown,"Guys, we've had some pretty legendary nights."

07x21,Unknown,"You ready to rock and roll, Ted?"
07x21,Unknown,"Yeah, I'm going home, too."
07x21,Unknown,I'm sensing some costumes coming up here and I'd rather steer clear.
07x21,Unknown,"Ted, 20 years from now, when you're all alone and I'm President, you're not gonna remember sitting around your apartment doing nothing."
07x21,Unknown,"What you will remember is that tonight, this night... was The Night We Started a Mariachi Band!"
07x21,Unknown,"Uno, dos, tres, quatro!"
07x21,Unknown,(mariachi song ends)
07x21,Unknown,(cheering)
07x21,Unknown,"Okay, you were right."
07x21,Unknown,Memorable night.
07x21,Unknown,That was nothing compared to
07x21,Unknown,"mañana,"
07x21,Unknown,amigo.
07x21,Unknown,Because
07x21,Unknown,mañana
07x21,Unknown,is gonna be...

07x21,Unknown,"Okay, but tomorrow..."
07x21,Unknown,Is The Night We Bungee Jump off the Statue of Liberty!
07x21,Unknown,Nope.

07x21,Unknown,That night was the night of Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall's fancy dinner.

07x21,Unknown,"Don't you always just take whatever you want, regardless of anything but your own dirty, sick, twisted appetites?"
07x21,Unknown,I'll stay on Broadway.

07x21,Unknown,Ranjit!
07x21,Unknown,Sorry.
07x21,Unknown,"Okay, yes, I did, but it didn't mean anything."
07x21,Unknown,"Okay, well, what happened in this dream?"
07x21,Unknown,And I want to know everything.
07x21,Unknown,Every explicit detail.
07x21,Unknown,Don't leave out any...
07x21,Unknown,"Damn it, Ranjit!"
07x21,Unknown,Sorry.
07x21,Unknown,"Marshall, it was a dream."
07x21,Unknown,"Yeah, well, dreams are just stuff that you subconsciously want to happen."
07x21,Unknown,Why do you think I'm constantly dreaming about Bigfoot playing quarterback for the Vikings?
07x21,Unknown,Because you fall asleep looking at a painting of it.
07x21,Unknown,It soothes me.
07x21,Unknown,Don't try to change the subject.
07x21,Unknown,You sleep-cheated.
07x21,Unknown,"You've been sleep-sleeping around, and I'm sick of it."
07x21,Unknown,"You know, I have half a mind to get out and let you eat all by yourself."
07x21,Unknown,Should I pull over?
07x21,Unknown,"Damn it, Ranjit!"
07x21,Unknown,"Yes, Ranjit. Pull over."
07x21,Unknown,Pulling over.
07x21,Unknown,"You watch, Ted."
07x21,Unknown,Tonight is going to be legen--
07x21,Unknown,it's the night we stole a camel...
07x21,Unknown,...which means it'll be full of drama-- dary.
07x21,Unknown,Dromedary!
07x21,Unknown,"I applaud your wordplay, but your core premise is flawed."
07x21,Unknown,Every night can't be legendary.
07x21,Unknown,"If all nights are legendary, no nights are legendary."
07x21,Unknown,"See, Ted, that attitude right there, that's why I'm in the lead."
07x21,Unknown,"What do you mean, in the lead?"
07x21,Unknown,"I'm talking about the game of life, Ted."
07x21,Unknown,Scoreboard.
07x21,Better wardrobe,75 points.
07x21,Apartment on a higher floor,90 points.
07x21,Longer name,110 points.
07x21,Unknown,Sorry. Did you just make up this point system?
07x21,Made up the point system,114 points.
07x21,Unknown,And ten points to you for pointing that out.
07x21,Unknown,"Nice job, Ted."
07x21,Unknown,15 points to me for being gracious enough to give you those ten points.
07x21,Unknown,"But here's the point, Ted."
07x21,Unknown,"Every time I go out and have an awesome night and you're not there, that's another 100 points in my column."
07x21,Unknown,"So yeah, I'm in the lead."
07x21,Unknown,"Barney, the fact that I can stay home for a night shows that I have inner peace and that I don't feel the need to keep score."
07x21,Unknown,That's worth like
07x21,Unknown,"1,000 points right there, so at the very least, we're tied."
07x21,Unknown,We're so not tied.
07x21,Unknown,Although you know what is tied--
07x21,Unknown,the strap of my girlfriend's bikini.
07x21,Unknown,"Except when it's not, 'cause she's a stripper."
07x21,Unknown,One million points! Game.
07x21,Unknown,Shh.
07x21,Unknown,It's over.
07x21,Unknown,It's done. It's done.
07x21,Unknown,So what do you do?
07x21,Unknown,(laughs)
07x21,Unknown,"You're kidding, right?"
07x21,Unknown,I... I'm an on-air reporter.
07x21,Unknown,I just did a report like five minutes ago.
07x21,Unknown,You sound frustrated.
07x21,Unknown,"Yeah, I am."
07x21,Unknown,"I'm busting my ass, and as usual, no recognition."
07x21,Unknown,"Robin, I've been doing this a while, and if there's one thing I've learned, it's flarm."
07x21,Unknown,What? Flarm.
07x21,Unknown,"Flarm, flarm, flarm."
07x21,Unknown,Blobbum.
07x21,(laughing),What is wrong with you?
07x21,Unknown,Are you having a stroke?
07x21,Unknown,Narrator
07x21,Unknown,"As a matter of fact, he was."
07x21,Unknown,Oh! Hold on! Wait!
07x21,Unknown,"Meanwhile, Lily was in desperate need of a female friend."
07x21,Unknown,"Lily, I have seen this a million times."
07x21,Unknown,Guys go crazy when there's a baby on the way.
07x21,Unknown,You should have seen the manager when his wife got pregnant.
07x21,Unknown,"After the second trimester, he made her stop stripping."
07x21,Unknown,"Yeah, you're right."
07x21,Unknown,Now I feel bad.
07x21,Unknown,Our big dinner's been ruined.
07x21,Unknown,Marshall's probably crying right now.
07x21,(crying),I had no idea that food could be this delicious.
07x21,Unknown,"Marshall, you are being crazy."
07x21,Unknown,"No, no, I can handle it."
07x21,Unknown,"If I sell my laptop, we can get seconds on those squash blossoms."
07x21,Unknown,I mean about Lily.
07x21,Unknown,"Well, you know, she's being crazy, too."
07x21,Unknown,She's pregnant.
07x21,Unknown,She gets to be crazy.
07x21,Unknown,You have to be the sane one.
07x21,Unknown,"So what, I don't get to be crazy again until the baby comes?"
07x21,Unknown,No. Then it's baby's turn to be crazy.
07x21,Unknown,When do I get to be crazy again?
07x21,Unknown,Never.
07x21,Unknown,(cackling)
07x21,Unknown,We are totally even.
07x21,Unknown,"We absolutely are not even, and here's why."
07x21,Unknown,"I'll grant you that if you include the 12 points for designing the skyscraper, the 83 points for slapping five with Tommy Lee and the 9,000 points for banging Robin before me, our point totals would be about neck and neck, but there's one thing you're forgetting."
07x21,Unknown,The fact that I don't care?
07x21,Unknown,No.
07x21,Unknown,And you just lost five points for sass.
07x21,Unknown,Do you remember a conversation we had about three years ago?
07x21,Unknown,"Barney, you're the king."
07x21,Unknown,Nobody picks up chicks like you.
07x21,Unknown,"You're handsome, debonair, everything I wish I could be."
07x21,Unknown,I'm starting to think this never happened.
07x21,Unknown,Let you finish.
07x21,Unknown,"You're smooth, charismatic, ""sauve."""
07x21,Unknown,"I think you mean ""suave."""
07x21,Unknown,Aha.
07x21,Unknown,So you do remember.
07x21,Unknown,"But there's one thing even a master ladies' man like you could never do, and if you could ever do it, it would be worth 500 points."
07x21,Unknown,"You have my attention, my slightly shorter friend."
07x21,Unknown,Here's the challenge.
07x21,Unknown,Get a girl's phone number while you're wearing a dress.
07x21,Unknown,Challenge...
07x21,Unknown,Accomplished.
07x21,Unknown,That's right.
07x21,"Last year, I slapped on a dress, took a few laps around this very bar, and I got this",the phone number of one Stephanie McColgan.
07x21,Unknown,"Later that night, I took off my pantyhose, and gave her panties... my hose."
07x21,Unknown,"That's right, Ted."
07x21,Unknown,I am 500 points ahead.
07x21,Unknown,"Until you can get a girl's digits while wearing a dress, you and I will never be even."
07x21,Unknown,"You know what? The super's probably waiting for me, and I just remembered there's a spare key under the doormat, so good night. Wait, wait."
07x21,Unknown,"Ted, don't go. Barney, I am leaving."
07x21,Unknown,I'm afraid this is just one of those nights we're probably going to forget.
07x21,Unknown,"I don't think so, dude. Look."

07x21,Unknown,This was one of those moments.

07x21,Unknown,(panting)
07x21,Unknown,I did it.
07x21,Unknown,I did it!
07x21,Unknown,(cheering)
07x21,Unknown,The pilot survived and made a full recovery.
07x21,Unknown,And Robin?
07x21,Unknown,"It's Robin Scherbatsky, everybody!"
07x21,Unknown,Thank you so much.
07x21,Unknown,"Oh, okay..."
07x21,Unknown,Robin got famous.

07x21,Unknown,and even have a deli sandwich named after her.
07x21,Unknown,"But most importantly, that night, she got a call, text or e-mail from almost everyone she'd ever met."

07x21,Unknown,"Okay, I'll keep trying."
07x21,Unknown,"Babe, I think I know why you had that sex dream about Ranjit. Why?"
07x21,Unknown,Think about it.
07x21,Unknown,The way he talks about his kids.
07x21,Unknown,He's a wonderful father.
07x21,Unknown,"Just like Papa Smurf, Bill Cosby..."
07x21,Unknown,"George Washington, the father of our country."
07x21,Unknown,You're attracted to great dads.
07x21,Unknown,And that's why you love me.
07x21,Unknown,Because I'm going to be the greatest dad ever.
07x21,Unknown,"Sure, that must be it."
07x21,Unknown,Narrator
07x21,Unknown,Lily decided not to tell Marshall about her dream involving Frankenstein and the tea cup from
07x21,Unknown,Beauty and the Beast.
07x21,Unknown,That one was just for her.

07x21,Unknown,Why can't we just go home?
07x21,Unknown,"I can't go home, Ted. Why not?"
07x21,Unknown,Because... I'm dating a stripper.
07x21,Unknown,"Yes, I've seen your bus ad."
07x21,Unknown,I get it.
07x21,Unknown,"No, you don't."

07x21,Unknown,If I don't do something to take my mind off of it...
07x21,Unknown,"You're lucky that you can just go sit around the house, Ted."
07x21,Unknown,I don't have that option.
07x21,Unknown,Wow.

07x22,Unknown,You didn't want to see Robin.

07x22,Unknown,Actually...
07x22,Unknown,"(gasps) Oh, no! Am I early?"
07x22,Unknown,Little bit.
07x22,Unknown,"Whoa, she got you the red stroller?"
07x22,Unknown,Looks like I just blew her out of the water.
07x22,Unknown,"Anyway, he left before the party started."

07x22,Unknown,50 laps a day?

07x22,Unknown,"Oh, is it?"
07x22,Unknown,"Is it a lot, Grandma Lois?"
07x22,Unknown,"Yes, my girlfriend gets naked and sits on guys' laps for money."
07x22,Unknown,"And, yes, sometimes it's as many as 50 laps in one day."

07x22,Unknown,"The photo was just of some girl I knew you'd never seen before, a very famous sports anchor on ESPN."
07x22,Unknown,"Barney, I don't need you to help me find a girl online."

07x22,Unknown,"Look, I know you mean well, but we have five weeks till the due date."
07x22,Unknown,Can't we use this time to just relax?
07x22,Unknown,We'll figure out how all this stuff works after the baby comes.
07x22,Unknown,After the baby comes?
07x22,Unknown,"Yeah, we'll learn on the job."
07x22,Unknown,Learn on the j... Huh.
07x22,Unknown,"Wow, you know, Lily, maybe the crisis here isn't that I'm not ready to be a dad; maybe it's that you're not ready to be a mom!"
07x22,Unknown,Excuse me?! Yeah.
07x22,Unknown,Narrator
07x22,Unknown,"With that, an argument began,"
07x22,Unknown,the details of which are still
07x22,Unknown,hotly debated to this day.
07x22,Unknown,I'm the only one making sacrifices for this baby!
07x22,Unknown,What?!
07x22,Unknown,It's like you don't even know that you're pregnant!
07x22,Unknown,Baby's are easy; you just watch them be cute and feed them spaghetti!
07x22,Unknown,"Marshall, what I need now is some peace, some quiet, and now that it's out there, some spaghetti."
07x22,Unknown,"Now, please help me off the couch so I can storm out."
07x22,(angry grunt),Huh!
07x22,Unknown,Narrator
07x22,Unknown,"The next day, I filled Barney in on my date."
07x22,Unknown,"Oh, Yobin."
07x22,Unknown,"No, Robin."
07x22,Unknown,"And for the rest of the night, every time I looked at her, I just saw Robin's face."
07x22,Unknown,"Well, I should hope so. No, our Robin."
07x22,Unknown,Robin with an I.
07x22,Unknown,"Uh, our Robin has two eyes, my friend."
07x22,Unknown,But that's good. You're forgetting what she looks like.
07x22,Unknown,"I'm sorry, that must have been tough."
07x22,Unknown,"If anyone knows what that feels like, it's me."
07x22,Unknown,My condolences.
07x22,Unknown,Okay. Moving on.
07x22,The next girl,perfect palate cleanser.
07x22,Unknown,Nothing like Robin.
07x22,Unknown,How nothing?
07x22,Unknown,I gaze out into the world and all I see is an icy place where dreams die.
07x22,Unknown,"Ooh, lasagna."
07x22,Unknown,"How's it going, Ted?"
07x22,Unknown,What? No. What? Wh-Why?
07x22,Unknown,"Remember, I made lasagna that one time."
07x22,Unknown,That's all it takes?
07x22,Unknown,It wasn't even lasagna; you took your botched kugle and poured tomato sauce on it.
07x22,Unknown,I didn't say it was good lasagna.
07x22,Unknown,"By the way, what are you doing with this girl?"
07x22,Unknown,With tattoos all up and down her arms and... everywhere else. Hello... good gravy.
07x22,Unknown,Does that dragons tail go all the way down to her...
07x22,(chuckling),"Ohh, yes, it does."
07x22,Unknown,"Well, what do you want me to do, Robin?"
07x22,Unknown,"I have to get over you somehow, and if this is what it takes..."
07x22,Unknown,Are you okay?
07x22,Unknown,Yeah. Why?
07x22,Unknown,You kind of spaced out there.
07x22,Unknown,"Weirdo. ""So, in summation, I'm very, very sorry."" ""I guess I just wanted you all to myself, ""and then I thought of all the creepy guys groping at your... ""Okay, I'm getting mad again, ""so I'm going to stop writing now."
07x22,Unknown,"Please enjoy these chocolates, may contain peanuts."""
07x22,Unknown,Kiss and make up?
07x22,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x22,Unknown,Have sex up against the window and make up? - (laughs)
07x22,Unknown,You do have a great view.
07x22,Unknown,"Well, funny you should mention that."
07x22,Unknown,It's
07x22,Unknown,your
07x22,Unknown,view.
07x22,Unknown,Come again for Big Fudge?
07x22,Unknown,Congratulations. You're hired.
07x22,Unknown,You are Goliath National Bank's newest executive strategy coordinator.
07x22,Unknown,What is an executive strategy coordinator?
07x22,Unknown,"It's three corporate-sounding words which, when added together, equal a fake job for which you get a real paycheck in the amount of exactly what you'd make stripping."
07x22,Unknown,Plus dental. You're welcs.
07x22,Unknown,"Now, about that up-against-the-window sex..."
07x22,Unknown,"Dude, I don't want to work for a bank."
07x22,Unknown,Why not?
07x22,Unknown,Because I have standards.
07x22,Unknown,You people are whores.
07x22,Unknown,"The things you're willing to do just for some money, it's shameful."
07x22,Unknown,You work in a strip club.
07x22,Unknown,"Yeah, and I like it."
07x22,Unknown,And I'm good at it.
07x22,Unknown,"Barney, if I took this job, you would own me."
07x22,Unknown,"I would be willingly stepping into a cage, which is something I don't do."
07x22,Unknown,"Except on Thursdays, when it's cage night at the Lusty Leopard, but that's a cardboard cage, and I can get out of it any time I want."
07x22,Unknown,You can?
07x22,Unknown,"Wow, thanks for ruining cage night."
07x22,Unknown,"Come on, Quinn."
07x22,Unknown,No.
07x22,Unknown,I wouldn't... Nope.
07x22,Unknown,Don't.
07x22,Unknown,I think I have some thinking to do.
07x22,Unknown,I...
07x22,Unknown,Mr. Stinson?
07x22,Unknown,Does this mean I get to keep my job?
07x22,Unknown,(sighs)
07x22,Unknown,"Yeah, Herm, you can stay."
07x22,Unknown,"Hey, baby, listen."
07x22,Unknown,I'm-I'm sorry I flipped out.
07x22,Unknown,"Oh, that's okay."
07x22,Unknown,"To be fair, maybe I'm at fault for loving our child too much, although that is the definition of parenting, so..."
07x22,Unknown,"All right, good make up."
07x22,Unknown,"Hey, listen, I went online, and I found this Baby Boot Camp thing that they're doing at a hotel in Paramus this weekend."
07x22,Unknown,Baby Boot Camp?
07x22,Unknown,That sounds great.
07x22,Unknown,"Yeah, it's a two-day event..."
07x22,Unknown,We're going.
07x22,Unknown,...and there's lots of seminars and classes.
07x22,Unknown,You've already made the sale.
07x22,Unknown,"Anyway, I signed us up."
07x22,Unknown,Not even listening anymore; mentally packing.
07x22,Unknown,I'm trying to figure out the best way to get to Paramus without hitting any tolls.
07x22,Unknown,This is gonna be great.
07x22,Unknown,And that was the last time I'll ever go out with a guy with a mustache.
07x22,Unknown,(both chuckling)
07x22,Unknown,This is good.
07x22,Unknown,"This is nice, not thinking about you-know-who."
07x22,Unknown,Just having a good time
07x22,Unknown,and thanking God I didn't grow
07x22,Unknown,that mustache.
07x22,Unknown,"And you, you're so polite."
07x22,Unknown,"My ex-fiancé, Wayne, he had no manners."
07x22,Unknown,Wayne had no manners.
07x22,Unknown,Wayne... manners...
07x22,Unknown,"Wayne Manor, home of Bruce Wayne, better known as Batman, mentor to d*ck Grayson, his orphan ward who at night would don the colorful vestments of the Boy Wonder, aka..."
07x22,(growling),Robin.
07x22,Unknown,"Holy long walk for a short drink of water, Ted."
07x22,Unknown,Stop this.
07x22,Unknown,I need you out of my life for real.
07x22,Unknown,You don't mean that.
07x22,Unknown,"Yes, I do."
07x22,Unknown,"No, you don't."
07x22,Unknown,Look how much is changing right now.
07x22,Unknown,Marshall and Lily are having a baby.
07x22,Unknown,Barney's shacking up with a girl.
07x22,Unknown,"With your whole world turning upside down, isn't a friendship like this one something you want to hold on to as tightly as possible?"
07x22,Unknown,"And every time I look at you, it hurts."
07x22,Unknown,...and that's the story of my only lesbian experience.
07x22,Unknown,I'm sorry for going into so much detail.
07x22,Unknown,I'll never tell that story again.
07x22,Unknown,"Anyway, how's your meal?"
07x22,Unknown,"Holly, listen, I should probably tell you, um, I'm kind of getting over someone right now."
07x22,Unknown,I am so glad you said that.
07x22,Unknown,I guess I'm still getting over Wayne.
07x22,Unknown,It's been really hard.
07x22,Unknown,Can I interest you in some sorbet?
07x22,Unknown,You two look like you could both use a palate cleanser.
07x22,Unknown,(exhales)
07x22,Unknown,"How's your palate, Ted?"
07x22,Unknown,Pretty cleansed.
07x22,Unknown,(chuckling)
07x22,Unknown,(groans)
07x22,Unknown,"You know, at this seminar, there's gonna be the one guy who's, like, Mr. Parenting Expert, keeps interrupting the speakers with his own ""important facts."""
07x22,Unknown,"And you're gonna be sitting right next to him, so get ready for that."
07x22,Unknown,"Baby, you've been a little sleep deprived lately."
07x22,Unknown,Why don't you let me drive?
07x22,Unknown,"You know what, that's not such a bad idea."
07x22,Unknown,"I mean, the last thing we want is for me to get behind the wheel and just..."
07x22,Unknown,(snoring)
07x22,Unknown,(groaning)
07x22,Unknown,(moans)
07x22,Unknown,"Oh, baby, you smell good."
07x22,Unknown,"When we get to that hotel, I'm gonna wear your pregnant belly like a hat."
07x22,Unknown,Barney
07x22,,You'll have to buy me a couple of cocktails first.
07x22,Unknown,Bar-Barney!
07x22,Unknown,Where are we?
07x22,Unknown,"Atlantic City, baby!"
07x22,Unknown,"Well, in 14 miles."
07x22,Unknown,What the hell is going on?
07x22,Unknown,And where is Lily?
07x22,Unknown,And what did you do to the practice baby?
07x22,Unknown,And is there any left?
07x22,Unknown,Lily was worried about you.
07x22,Unknown,"She thought you needed to unwind, so..."
07x22,Unknown,"I mean, the last thing we want is for me to get behind the wheel and just..."
07x22,Unknown,(snoring)
07x22,Unknown,Barney
07x22,Unknown,"She made reservations for two deluxe rooms, massages, and dinner at the Palm, and in return, I made her cookies."
07x22,Unknown,"So, there's no Baby Boot Camp at the Paramus Waldorf?"
07x22,Unknown,Is there even a Paramus Waldorf?
07x22,Unknown,Bro...
07x22,Unknown,I am so mad at Lily right now.
07x22,Unknown,She knew you would be; that's why she packed this.
07x22,Unknown,Aw.
07x22,Unknown,My mad-at-Lily shirt.
07x22,Unknown,"I had this made for me and my high school girlfriend, Steph."
07x22,Unknown,"In reality, ""Marshall and Steph 4-eva"" turned out to be ""Marshall and Steph for two days until Steph's boyfriend got out of juvie a week early."""
07x22,Unknown,Drives Lily crazy when I wear it.
07x22,Unknown,I hope she's miserable without me.
07x22,Unknown,(crunching)
07x22,Unknown,"Hey, Ted, how's tricks?"
07x22,Unknown,"Tricks are pretty good, Lou."
07x22,Unknown,"Had some girl trouble earlier in the week, but, uh, I got a feeling from here on out, things are gonna be A..."
07x22,Unknown,"O-Oh, you son of a b*tch."
07x22,Unknown,Hello.
07x22,Unknown,(cheering)
07x22,Unknown,Lily's right.
07x22,Unknown,I've been acting crazy.
07x22,Unknown,"No, it's okay, bro."
07x22,Unknown,"I mean, yeah, you've been a little crazy, but it comes from love."
07x22,Unknown,"It's the same kind of crazy that makes a man offer his stripper girlfriend over half a million dollars of government bailout money, not to rub up on other guys' junk."
07x22,Unknown,It's good crazy.
07x22,Unknown,(gamblers groaning)
07x22,Unknown,"I hope Lily's okay. Okay, you know, that's it, bro."
07x22,Unknown,We're both turning off our phones for one hour.
07x22,Unknown,Motion denied.
07x22,Unknown,"Okay, you leave me no choice."
07x22,Proposal,"you give me one hour of phone-free bro time, during which we, and by we I mean you, get magnificently, mythologically drunk."
07x22,Unknown,I'm talking needing-subtitles-
07x22,Unknown,when-you-speak drunk.
07x22,Unknown,"If you can give me that, I will wear this."
07x22,Unknown,The ducky tie?
07x22,Unknown,I thought you threw that thing away.
07x22,Unknown,I did.
07x22,Unknown,It came back.
07x22,Unknown,"All right, Barney, you got yourself a deal."
07x22,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x22,Unknown,(beep)
07x22,Unknown,"Um, excuse me, miss."
07x22,Unknown,"Um, when you get a chance, could you bring over a hundred sh*ts of tequila, please?"
07x22,Unknown,I'll have the same.
07x22,Unknown,Why are you still here?
07x22,Unknown,Why do you think I'm still here?
07x22,Unknown,I guess because I'm in love with you.
07x22,Unknown,Why else would I be seeing your face everywhere I look?
07x22,Unknown,Because you feel bad.
07x22,Unknown,Of course I feel bad.
07x22,Unknown,"I told you I love you, which is apparently the worst thing you can say to someone."
07x22,Unknown,That's not why you feel bad.
07x22,Unknown,"You feel bad because after you said it, you let me go away."
07x22,Unknown,"I know our relationship isn't exactly what you want it to be, and I know I may not love you the way you love me, but I do love you."
07x22,Unknown,Isn't that worth hanging on to?
07x22,Unknown,(sighs)
07x22,Unknown,I miss you.
07x22,Unknown,So go get me back.
07x22,Unknown,(exhales)
07x22,Unknown,Robin?
07x22,Unknown,Ted.
07x22,Unknown,It's good to really see you.
07x22,Unknown,It's really good to see you.
07x22,Unknown,"Look, I think we need to talk."
07x22,Unknown,"Uh, me, too, but now's not a good time."
07x22,Unknown,Why not?
07x22,Unknown,"I am proud of you, bro."
07x22,Unknown,"You turned off your phone for one hour, and you got so drunk..."
07x22,Unknown,(mumbling)
07x22,Unknown,Exactly.
07x22,Unknown,"Hey, (mumbles)."
07x22,Unknown,"Yes, Marshall?"
07x22,Unknown,(speaking untelligibly)
07x22,Unknown,"Well, I don't see why not."
07x22,Unknown,Whoa! I've got
07x22,Unknown,17 new voicemails.
07x22,Unknown,"Barney, it's Lily."
07x22,Unknown,You guys need to get back to New York right away.
07x22,Unknown,I'm in labor.
07x22,Unknown,(Marshall yelling)
07x22,Unknown,All hail Beercules!
07x22,Unknown,(laughing) Yeah!
07x22,Unknown,(laughing)
07x22,Unknown,(groans)
07x22,Unknown,"All right, Barney, you got yourself a deal."
07x22,Unknown,(beep)
07x22,Unknown,"Hey, you've reached Marshall."
07x22,Unknown,Please leave a message.
07x22,Unknown,(beep)
07x22,Unknown,"Hey, baby, it's me."
07x22,Unknown,I think I'm in labor.
07x22,Unknown,(coughs) We should do this every weekend.
07x22,Unknown,(beep)
07x22,Unknown,"Okay, this is real."
07x22,Unknown,It's not a false alarm.
07x22,Unknown,This is real; I'm in labor.
07x22,Unknown,I kind of need you to call me back now.
07x22,Unknown,How does somebody so little have such strong fingers?
07x22,Unknown,Call me!
07x22,Unknown,He is the manager of the Paramus Waldorf.
07x22,Unknown,"You come to Paramus, we will hook you up."
07x22,Unknown,"(beep) If you're trying to get back at me, you have chosen a wildly inappropriate way of doing so!"
07x22,Unknown,"Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah."
07x23,Unknown,Narrator
07x23,Unknown,"Kids, when Aunt Lily went into labor, Marshall was somewhere slightly inconvenient, in Atlantic City with Uncle Barney, and drunk to the point of talking like Yoda."
07x23,Unknown,Baby come...
07x23,Unknown,Papa gonna be am I...
07x23,Unknown,Hospital must we get now...
07x23,Unknown,"Okay, there's like a four-hour wait at the valet stand."
07x23,Unknown,"Plus, we're in no shape to drive. So, a car's out..."
07x23,Unknown,"Wait, don't worry. We'll take a cab to the train station."
07x23,Unknown,Man
07x23,,"Yeah, good luck getting a cab."
07x23,Unknown,It's impossible because of the big thing.
07x23,Unknown,Narrator
07x23,Unknown,"Kids, for the life of me, I can't remember what the big thing was in Atlantic City that weekend."
07x23,Unknown,SON
07x23,Unknown,Was it a cheerleading convention?
07x23,Unknown,Narrator
07x23,Unknown,"No, it was a porn convention."
07x23,Unknown,Sci-fi convention?
07x23,Unknown,"Eh, I can't remember."
07x23,Unknown,We're stuck in Atlantic City! City of Atlantic stuck in are we.

07x23,Unknown,We are not freaking out. We are not freaking out!
07x23,Unknown,I feel calmer already. Let's get you to the hospital.
07x23,Unknown,"Oh, I can't go yet. I talked to Dr. Sonya."
07x23,Unknown,They won't admit me until my contractions are four minutes apart.
07x23,Unknown,"Okay, well, if you don't make it in time, I have got you covered. When I was 13, my father caught me kissing a boy, so he sent me to our family's ranch for foaling season. Once you see a baby horse erupt through that birth canal, you stop even touching yourself."

07x23,Unknown,So what I need right now is distraction from the pain.

07x23,Unknown,What's the middle name?
07x23,Unknown,Wait for it...
07x23,Unknown,I'm waiting.
07x23,Unknown,Wait for it...
07x23,Unknown,I said I'm waiting.
07x23,Unknown,Wait for it. What's the middle name?
07x23,Unknown,"No, the middle name is ""Wait For It."""
07x23,Unknown,"Let's say his first name is, oh, I don't know, Barney."
07x23,Unknown,"He'd be Barney ""Wait For It"" Eriksen."
07x23,Unknown,How awesome is that?
07x23,Unknown,That is... the coolest... middle name of all time.
07x23,Unknown,"I know! Okay, listen."
07x23,Unknown,I have a plan to get us to New York.

07x23,Unknown,Just keep telling me stories!

07x23,Unknown,"I don't normally go to, um, second base and tell, but I just spent a magical night with Neil Young."
07x23,(whispers),He's still in my room.
07x23,Unknown,"Seriously? Oh, my God."
07x23,Unknown,"Be quiet, don't scare him off."
07x23,Unknown,(clears throat)
07x23,Unknown,He-Hey...
07x23,Unknown,Robin... Yeah.
07x23,Unknown,That's not Neil Young.
07x23,Unknown,"Oh, God."
07x23,Unknown,(both laughing)
07x23,Unknown,"Oh, we're busting apple bags? I can bust apple bags."
07x23,Unknown,"Ted, remember when we were dating and we threw that party and one of those appetizers just didn't sit right?"
07x23,Unknown,Ah... doesn't sound familiar.

07x23,Unknown,Okay.
07x23,Unknown,"Hey, I've never noticed that door before."
07x23,Unknown,I wonder where it goes.
07x23,Unknown,Ted. Ted.

07x23,Unknown,"I was okay with you e-mailing my aunt, my cousins, and your cousins, and the guy that Robin thought was Neil Young."
07x23,Unknown,But my father is the absolute worst person to have around in any sort of medical situation.
07x23,Unknown,Lily
07x23,Unknown,"When I was seven, I needed to have my tonsils out."
07x23,Unknown,"Daddy, I'm scared."
07x23,Unknown,"Aw, Princess, I would be too. I've researched this surgery."
07x23,Unknown,Anything can happen. You could bleed to death...
07x23,Unknown,"...you could have your jaw removed due to infection, and the anesthesia could suddenly just stop working, much like your mom's and my marriage."
07x23,Unknown,(laughing)
07x23,Unknown,You do know that we're getting a divor...
07x23,Unknown,Don't worry about it. We'll talk about it after the surgery.

07x23,Unknown,"(all chuckle) And then the lady at the thrift store said that for years, no one so much as tried them on. Can you believe that?"
07x23,Unknown,Yes.
07x23,Unknown,You know what this means?
07x23,Unknown,These pants are cursed.
07x23,Unknown,What's this in the pocket?
07x23,Unknown,A clue.
07x23,Unknown,Ted
07x23,Unknown,Marshall had the writing translated.
07x23,Unknown,It led him deep into the heart of Chinatown.
07x23,Unknown,(gasps) It is you.
07x23,Unknown,The One has arrived.
07x23,Unknown,"Dry cleaning, $21.50."
07x23,Unknown,I remember that suit. He looked like a little kid's imaginary friend.

07x23,Unknown,"Plus, here's the best part."
07x23,Unknown,"This Quinn thing is probably done, so I'm basically single."
07x23,Unknown,He said the bus is full of hot college seniors.

07x23,Unknown,So where exactly in New York does this bus drop off?
07x23,Unknown,Buffalo.
07x23,Unknown,What do you mean I can't have an epidural?
07x23,Unknown,You're too far along.

07x24,Unknown,(camera snapping)
07x24,Unknown,"These are terrible, Robin!"
07x24,Unknown,"Hey, it is not easy getting a good shot cooped up in this apartment!"
07x24,"See, two different styles","I make compositions, Robin makes excuses."
07x24,Unknown,Click!
07x24,Unknown,Photo burn!
07x24,Unknown,Okay. How about this?
07x24,Unknown,"Tomorrow, we go to Central Park at sunset and we get the perfect picture in the perfect setting."
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, I like that."
07x24,Unknown,It'll be Marvin's first outing into the world.
07x24,Unknown,"You're gonna love the park, buddy."
07x24,Unknown,It's a great place to meet chicks.
07x24,Unknown,Or-or dudes.
07x24,Unknown,Or both.
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, we love you no matter what!"
07x24,Unknown,Narrator
07x24,Unknown,"And kids, as I watched your Aunt Lily hold her baby boy, another thought popped into my head."
07x24,Unknown,"Even though you didn't buy anything, I want to thank you for coming in."
07x24,Unknown,Here's a free teddy bear.
07x24,Unknown,What are you gonna name the little guy?
07x24,Unknown,Six Pack.
07x24,Unknown,"g*n it, b*tches!"
07x24,Unknown,(engine revs)
07x24,Unknown,Narrator
07x24,Unknown,That girl's a mom!
07x24,Unknown,(engine revving)
07x24,Unknown,(phone chimes)
07x24,Unknown,"Okay, so I met this girl on the train, and I texted her, ""What's up"""""
07x24,Unknown,"She texted, ""Hey,"" exclamation point."
07x24,Unknown,"Does that mean, ""Ask me out"" or ""Just..."""
07x24,"Ted, we are responsible for a whole other human life now, so new rule","You can't come to us with any issue unless it's an ""8"" or higher."
07x24,Unknown,Got it.
07x24,Unknown,So I'm thinking of texting back a winky smiley face.
07x24,Unknown,"Eight or higher, bro."
07x24,Unknown,"Well, no, what should I--"
07x24,Unknown,"Eight or higher, bro."
07x24,Unknown,"No, yeah, I'm just wondering if--"
07x24,Unknown,"Eight or higher, bro."
07x24,Unknown,"Well, where do you rate this?"
07x24,This is the same as what's in little Marvin's pants right now,a soft two.
07x24,Unknown,"Sorry, bro."
07x24,Unknown,Stop texting the bimbo and call Victoria.
07x24,Unknown,That chapter's over.
07x24,Unknown,"W-We just weren't destined to be together. ""Destined."" Aren't you tired of waiting for destiny, Ted?"
07x24,Unknown,Isn't it time to make your own destiny?
07x24,Unknown,"Hey, false alarm."
07x24,Unknown,"What I was smelling was the previous poop, which, apparently, is still somewhere on my clothes and/or in my hair."
07x24,Unknown,"Hold him, would you? Oh. Here."
07x24,Unknown,"Ooh. Yeah, smart."
07x24,Unknown,(shutter clicking)
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, sure, that one turns out great. Ugh."
07x24,Unknown,Narrator
07x24,,And then another thought popped
07x24,into my head,That guy's nowhere near being a dad.
07x24,Unknown,(line ringing)
07x24,Unknown,VICTORIA
07x24,,Hello?
07x24,Unknown,"Hey, Victoria, it's Ted."
07x24,Unknown,"Um, listen, I was just wondering if you wanted to catch up sometime; it's been a while."
07x24,Unknown,That sounds nice.
07x24,Unknown,I'm actually around this afternoon.
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, wow, uh, great."
07x24,MacLaren's at 2,00?
07x24,Is 1,30 okay?
07x24,Unknown,I might have a thing later.
07x24,Unknown,Yeah. Yeah. See you then.
07x24,Unknown,See you then.
07x24,Unknown,Narrator
07x24,Unknown,"Meanwhile, Barney and Quinn were off to Hawaii for their first getaway as a couple."
07x24,Unknown,"Ma'am, I need you to open your suitcase."
07x24,(sighing),It's mine.
07x24,Unknown,"Did you have to replace my luggage, too?"
07x24,Unknown,"Run away on me again, you'll be wearing hot pink stilettos."
07x24,Unknown,What's that?
07x24,Unknown,"Yeah, what is that?"
07x24,Unknown,It's a magic trick.
07x24,Unknown,"You see, I'm something of a magician."
07x24,Unknown,"Open the box, sir."
07x24,(laughing),"Oh, I can't do that."
07x24,Unknown,(barking)
07x24,Unknown,"Sir, are there dr*gs in that box?"
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, no. He's probably just barking because of the expl*sives."
07x24,Unknown,(gasps)
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, my God!"
07x24,Unknown,Tell us what's in the box right now!
07x24,Unknown,I can't.
07x24,Unknown,Magician's Code.
07x24,Unknown,Ted
07x24,Unknown,"Okay, I need to figure out if Victoria ever got engaged."
07x24,Unknown,I'll have to very subtly check for an engagement ring.
07x24,Unknown,"Hmm, can't see the left hand."
07x24,Unknown,Open the box now!
07x24,Unknown,I can't.
07x24,Unknown,Magician's Code.
07x24,Unknown,"What the hell is the Magician's Code?! ""A magician never reveals his tricks."""
07x24,Unknown,"Mr. Flanagan, my magic mentor from the hallowed Staten Island Mall Magic Shop, taught me the importance of the Code one fateful autumn night in 1993."
07x24,Unknown,Always good to tell a long story while people are aiming g*ns at you. 'Twas a night which would changed my life...
07x24,Unknown,(thudding)
07x24,Unknown,Hello? Mr. Flanagan.
07x24,Unknown,Wh-What are you doing here?
07x24,Unknown,Um... I'm checking up on you.
07x24,Unknown,Just to make sure you're practicing your craft or whatever.
07x24,Unknown,"That is an honor, sir."
07x24,Unknown,"And yeah, I promise, I'm practicing."
07x24,Unknown,But wait.
07x24,Unknown,"Why were you, why were you going in my mom's room?"
07x24,Unknown,Uh... your mom's actually helping me with a new trick.
07x24,Unknown,That is so cool!
07x24,Unknown,What is this trick?
07x24,Unknown,Is it sawing a lady in half?
07x24,Unknown,(wry chuckle)
07x24,Unknown,"Well, not sawing."
07x24,Unknown,"But actually, the Magician's Code forbids me from telling you anything else about the trick."
07x24,Unknown,Loretta
07x24,,"Wayne, come back to bed!"
07x24,Unknown,"Okay, it involves a bed."
07x24,Unknown,W-W-Wait. Can you at least tell me the name of this trick?
07x24,Unknown,"Sure, kid."
07x24,Unknown,It's called--
07x24,Unknown,The Disappearing Salami.
07x24,Unknown,Mr. Flanagan's wife shot him before he could ever tell me what the trick was.
07x24,Unknown,"Yeah, that guy was banging your mom."
07x24,Unknown,Yup.
07x24,Unknown,Totally.
07x24,Unknown,Mr. Flanagan was not ban--
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, my God, he was."
07x24,Unknown,"Wait, why are you bringing a magic trick to Hawaii anyway?"
07x24,Unknown,I was hoping to sh**t up to Honolulu for the Worldwide Magic Convention.
07x24,Unknown,Don't worry. You'll notice I was gone.
07x24,Unknown,It's only three
07x24,Unknown,14-hour days.
07x24,Unknown,"So on our romantic getaway to help me forget about you skipping town on me, you're skipping town on me?!"
07x24,Unknown,"Look Quinn, you're very important to me, but you're sharing my heart with an equally important Miss."
07x24,Unknown,Miss...
07x24,Unknown,Direction.
07x24,Unknown,What?
07x24,Unknown,H...
07x24,Unknown,sh**t him.
07x24,Unknown,So what did you order?
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, just black coffee."
07x24,Unknown,"I like it that way, too."
07x24,Unknown,"Yeah, it just tastes better to me."
07x24,Unknown,"I find that if the coffee beans are good enough, you really don't need--"
07x24,Unknown,Why are you in a wedding dress?!
07x24,Unknown,"Well, I'm sort of supposed to... get married today."
07x24,Unknown,All your friends and family are waiting for you in some church right now?
07x24,Unknown,"Well, not all; we had five last-minute no-shows."
07x24,Unknown,Well... six.
07x24,Unknown,"Mazel tov, Ted."
07x24,Unknown,I was starting to think this would never happen.
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, no, Mrs. Matsen--"
07x24,MRS. MATSEN,I told you he wasn't gay.
07x24,Unknown,"Wait, what?"
07x24,Unknown,I was tempted to leave Klaus for you last fall.
07x24,Unknown,The only thing holding me back was the Robin of it all.
07x24,Unknown,"I know, and you were right, but... but that's all over now."
07x24,Unknown,"She moved out-- I mean, we're still friends, but that's over."
07x24,Unknown,"All these years, I never stopped thinking about you, Ted."
07x24,Unknown,I've got a car outside if you're ready to drive off into the sunset together.
07x24,Unknown,"But if you don't feel the same way, if you've closed the door on us, just say the word... and I'll go."
07x24,Unknown,"Barney, tell them the trick."
07x24,Unknown,The only person I could possibly reveal the trick to is another magician.
07x24,Unknown,"Well, I'm a magician."
07x24,Unknown,Prove it.
07x24,Unknown,Whoo-hoo!
07x24,Unknown,(gasps)
07x24,Unknown,Narrator
07x24,Unknown,That's Barney's version.
07x24,Unknown,Quinn said it was a simple card trick.
07x24,Unknown,Who's to say which version was true?
07x24,Unknown,Quinn's. Quinn's version was true.
07x24,Unknown,Okay.
07x24,Unknown,I'll tell you.
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, that's really cool."
07x24,Unknown,So what's the trick?
07x24,Unknown,I can't say. Magician's Code.
07x24,(gasps),Ta-da... da-da-da-da-da-da.
07x24,Unknown,(cell phone ringing)
07x24,Unknown,Hello.
07x24,Unknown,Why did you make me call Victoria?
07x24,Unknown,She's here in a wedding dress.
07x24,Unknown,I'm the verge of ruining a wedding!
07x24,Unknown,"And Mrs. Madsen's friend thinks I'm gay, but let's put a pin in that till later."
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, my God. Victoria's at the bar with Ted."
07x24,Unknown,That's a seven.
07x24,Unknown,And she's in a wedding dress.
07x24,Unknown,That's a ten.
07x24,Unknown,We got a ten!
07x24,Unknown,What are you gonna do? Where is she right now?
07x24,Unknown,"So this dress, what's the cut?"
07x24,Unknown,"Are we talking princess, ball gown, column?"
07x24,Unknown,"Right, 'cause it's a federal crime to love weddings."
07x24,Unknown,"She's in the bathroom, which I guess takes forever with that giant poufy skirt thing."
07x24,Unknown,Ball gown. Thank you.
07x24,Unknown,Four sh*ts of tequila.
07x24,Unknown,"Ted, calm down."
07x24,Unknown,Or not. This is your chance to get the one who got away.
07x24,Unknown,"You want her, she wants you, what's the problem?"
07x24,Unknown,The problem is Victoria's in the middle of a giant freak-out.
07x24,Unknown,What if she winds up regretting this decision?
07x24,Unknown,She's going after Ted Mosby.
07x24,Unknown,That's the best decision she's ever made.
07x24,Unknown,There you go.
07x24,Unknown,Whoa. What was that? What?
07x24,Unknown,You said you wanted a picture of Baby Marvin's first outing.
07x24,Unknown,Our baby's first outing was to a bar.
07x24,Unknown,(gasps)
07x24,Unknown,I dribble Cuervo on Marv's soft spot.
07x24,Unknown,Here she comes! Quick!
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."
07x24,Unknown,Eggshell or cream?
07x24,Unknown,Is it eggshell or cream?
07x24,Unknown,So.
07x24,Unknown,You... me... riding off into the sunset.
07x24,Unknown,Any thoughts?
07x24,One question,"FDR or Westside Highway, what's the quickest way to the sunset?"
07x24,Unknown,"Man, I wind up in these rooms a lot."
07x24,Unknown,"If we miss Hawaii because of this, guess who's not doing The Disappearing Salami anytime soon?"
07x24,Unknown,I need to ask you both a few questions.
07x24,Unknown,Let's start with you.
07x24,Unknown,Name?
07x24,Unknown,Quinn Garvey.
07x24,Unknown,Occupation?
07x24,Unknown,Unemployed.
07x24,Unknown,"Well, well, well."
07x24,Unknown,Look who's keeping secrets now.
07x24,"Sir, I'll tell you her occupation",stripper.
07x24,Unknown,"She insists she's proud of it, but apparently not proud enough to tell you."
07x24,Unknown,"Barney, I was going to surprise you with this on our trip, but... I quit."
07x24,Unknown,You... did that for me?
07x24,Unknown,Yes.
07x24,Unknown,"And now that you know what I did for you, and how much I care for you, would you please show him the trick?"
07x24,Unknown,Sorry. Magician's Code.
07x24,Unknown,Where should we go?
07x24,Unknown,Your place?
07x24,Unknown,My place?
07x24,Unknown,We could go on my honeymoon.
07x24,Unknown,(laughs)
07x24,Unknown,Just kidding.
07x24,Unknown,"Although, it is paid for."
07x24,Unknown,I know where we should go. Where?
07x24,Unknown,Your wedding.
07x24,Unknown,I'm taking you back.
07x24,Unknown,I don't understand.
07x24,Unknown,I thought you wanted this.
07x24,Unknown,I do want this.
07x24,Unknown,I've thought about you so many times.
07x24,Unknown,What might have been...
07x24,Unknown,"But I got left at the altar, and it nearly k*lled me."
07x24,Unknown,"You're someone's fiancé, and I have to respect that."
07x24,Unknown,"So let's hit a motel, jam in a quickie, and get you back to your wedding."
07x24,Unknown,(giggles)
07x24,Unknown,It's the right thing to do.
07x24,Unknown,Some part of me needed to hear you say that running away together wasn't an option.
07x24,Unknown,And now that I know that... it's like I'm sobering up.
07x24,Unknown,Is there any way that we can just pretend this never happened?
07x24,Unknown,This never happened.
07x24,Unknown,Mr. Flanagan wasn't banging my mom.
07x24,Unknown,Well.
07x24,Unknown,Your flight left.
07x24,Unknown,We need to hold Mr. Stinson for further questioning.
07x24,Unknown,But you're free to go.
07x24,Unknown,Maybe I should.
07x24,Unknown,Wait!
07x24,Unknown,I'll show you the trick.
07x24,Unknown,Sir!
07x24,Unknown,May I please have the silk handkerchief in your top left breast pocket?
07x24,Unknown,Well... I don't have...
07x24,Unknown,(chuckles)
07x24,Unknown,(clears throat)
07x24,Unknown,Sim salabi ma... sim salabi ma...
07x24,Unknown,(gasps)
07x24,Unknown,"Relax, relax, it's part of the trick."
07x24,Unknown,How did you get that through the X-Ray machine?
07x24,Unknown,"No questions from the audience, please!"
07x24,Unknown,(chanting nonsense syllables)
07x24,Unknown,What is that?
07x24,Unknown,"Madam, may I please have the key on your necklace?"
07x24,Unknown,Oh!
07x24,Unknown,(giggles)
07x24,Unknown,(beeping)
07x24,Unknown,Is that gonna explode?
07x24,Unknown,What?
07x24,Unknown,(screams)
07x24,Unknown,(coughing)
07x24,Unknown,Ahem.
07x24,Unknown,(mock gasps)
07x24,Unknown,What?
07x24,(loudly),Will you marry me?
07x24,Unknown,Yes.
07x24,Unknown,(laughing)
07x24,Unknown,"Come on, guys."
07x24,Unknown,We're losing the light for Baby's Second First Outing.
07x24,Unknown,Narrator
07x24,Unknown,"I hate to say it, but Robin nailed it."
07x24,Unknown,(door closes)
07x24,Unknown,"Hey. Guys, we've got something to tell you."
07x24,Unknown,"Eight or higher, bro."
07x24,Unknown,We're engaged.
07x24,Unknown,That's a... that's a ten.
07x24,Unknown,We got another ten!
07x24,Unknown,"Oh... Wow, big day!"
07x24,Unknown,Congratulations! Thank you.
07x24,Unknown,How did this happen?
07x24,Unknown,Oh... magic.
07x24,Unknown,Oh.
07x24,Unknown,"Uh, not to ruin the moment, but apparently little Marvin is quite stunned by the news."
07x24,Unknown,Well...
07x24,Unknown,Yeah. Wow. Yeah.
07x24,Unknown,Do you guys mind recounting this romantic tale next to a Diaper Genie?
07x24,Unknown,"Oh, Marvin, you're about to hear your first love story!"
07x24,Unknown,QUINN
07x24,,"Once up on a time, this creepy magic dude was boning Barney's mom..."
07x24,Unknown,It's our last chance to run away together.
07x24,Unknown,Door's right there.
07x24,Unknown,"Yes, we'll start a new life."
07x24,Unknown,Head for the border! Canada!
07x24,Unknown,"Eh, Mexico. Canada sucks."
07x24,Unknown,"Okay, well, you're one-quarter Canadian, so by that logic you one-quarter suck."
07x24,Unknown,I'm 100% awesome and you know it.
07x24,Unknown,"Yeah, I do."
07x24,Unknown,(clears throat)
07x24,Unknown,"Look, I-I hope this isn't weird, or anything, because..."
07x24,Unknown,Barney...
