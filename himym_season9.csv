09x01,Unknown,"Kids, Barney and Robin's wedding turned out to be a life-changing weekend for all of us. Well, not just us."
09x01,Unknown,"One ticket to Farhampton, please."
09x01,Unknown,But I'll get to that.
09x01,Unknown,(horn honks)
09x01,Unknown,Who are you honking at? You.
09x01,Unknown,You're going 40 in a 65.
09x01,Unknown,"Pick it up, Grandma!"
09x01,Unknown,"Look, I'm happy to rock it up into the 50s, but I'm gonna need a hand... or two."
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, no. Not the driving gloves."
09x01,Unknown,"In 99.9% of highway accidents, the driver was not wearing gloves."
09x01,Unknown,Because they're stupid.
09x01,Unknown,They don't help you drive better.
09x01,Unknown,That's why no one wears them.
09x01,Unknown,Then why is it called... the glove compartment?
09x01,Unknown,I am not having this argument again.
09x01,Unknown,"Now, as you know, a Mosby road trip is not only safe, but informative."
09x01,Unknown,Chiggedy-check it.

09x01,Unknown,That baby's stuffed to the rings with fun facts about our unsung neighbor to the east-- Long Island.
09x01,Unknown,"For instance, just up ahead, the historic childhood home of Florian van Otterloop, the Dutch bucklesmith who revolutionized the belt industry."
09x01,Unknown,"Uh, fun story about that color-blind genius."
09x01,Unknown,When he... Please stop!

09x01,Unknown,(laughs)
09x01,Unknown,Does she actually ride a moose?
09x01,Unknown,Yeah.
09x01,Unknown,"And, uh, I'm worried she'll bring it to the wedding."
09x01,Unknown,She and the moose are... very close.
09x01,Unknown,Whoa.

09x01,Unknown,Aren't you gonna check that?
09x01,Unknown,No.
09x01,Unknown,It-It's just another obnoxious update from Marshall's mom.

09x01,Unknown,There's a train station coming up; just drop me off.
09x01,Unknown,"Okay, but some newfangled train's not gonna stop at the 40-foot-tall butter churn in Ronkonkoma!"
09x01,Unknown,"Yes, but unlike any of your 18th-century stops, at least the train will have a 21st-century toilet!"
09x01,Unknown,You're a 21st-century toilet!
09x01,Unknown,(gasps)
09x01,Unknown,Train now!
09x01,Unknown,Fine!
09x01,Unknown,"Okay, so far, I've got 12 wild cards, not counting the ring bear."
09x01,Unknown,Ring bear-er.
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, oh, here's another one."
09x01,Unknown,You know how I found out that I'm one-quarter Canadian but I've completely blocked that out because your nation's ridiculous and I'm awesome?
09x01,Unknown,Sure.
09x01,Unknown,"Well, turns out, I have a crazy cousin Mitch on that side of the family."
09x01,Unknown,That's funny.
09x01,Unknown,"I have a crazy cousin Mitch, too."
09x01,Unknown,But I guarantee he is crazier than yours.
09x01,Unknown,He built his own house from timber he chopped down from other people's houses.
09x01,Unknown,That's funny.
09x01,Unknown,My cousin Mitch is a lumberjack.
09x01,Unknown,Except mine has six fingers.
09x01,Unknown,On one hand or total?
09x01,Unknown,Total.
09x01,Unknown,Are truckers always beating him up?
09x01,Unknown,"Yes, because he has to..."
09x01,BOTH,...hitchhike with his middle finger.
09x01,Unknown,Wait.
09x01,Unknown,Is it possible that we're...
09x01,Unknown,Could... c-could... could we be...?

09x01,Unknown,Pulling over!

09x01,Unknown,"All right, train."
09x01,Unknown,Let's show your critics you're not just a Dumpster on wheels full of drunk idiots.
09x01,CONDUCTOR,We're being held at this station until further notice.

09x01,Unknown,"Just take it down, okay?"
09x01,Unknown,Fine.

09x01,Unknown,No.
09x01,Unknown,"Hell, I've been going to Pilates."
09x01,Unknown,I can just hang on to the landing gear like this.
09x01,Unknown,"Sorry, ma'am."
09x01,Unknown,"I only signed up for Pilates, I haven't actually started going yet."
09x01,Unknown,I didn't sign up.
09x01,Unknown,"No, I'm not looking."
09x01,Unknown,I don't need to see my child used against me.
09x01,Unknown,"My sweet, beautiful child who I haven't seen in a week... whose head smells like love and unicorn teardrops, and why are trains so lonely?!"
09x01,Unknown,"Damn it, I'm looking!"
09x01,WOMAN,"Hey, are you okay?"
09x01,Unknown,You look stressed.
09x01,Unknown,"Plus, you muttered a few words out loud."
09x01,Unknown,"I heard ""lonely"" and ""unicorn,"" which actually gave me a great idea for a children's book, so thank you."
09x01,Unknown,Are you okay?
09x01,Unknown,No.
09x01,Unknown,But there's nothing you can do.
09x01,Unknown,Do you want a cookie?
09x01,(crying),Yes.
09x01,Unknown,"Yes, I do."
09x01,Unknown,Wow.
09x01,Unknown,You just took a cookie from a complete stranger on a train.
09x01,Unknown,I like how trusting you are.
09x01,Unknown,There could be dr*gs or poison in there.
09x01,Unknown,"But there's not, is there?"
09x01,Unknown,"No idea, I found them under my seat."
09x01,Unknown,No!
09x01,Unknown,Kidding! Sorry!
09x01,Unknown,"You looked stressed, so I thought you could use a cookie, then I thought you could use a joke."
09x01,Unknown,I should have stopped at the cookie.
09x01,Unknown,You know what?
09x01,Unknown,I don't care if these are poisoned.
09x01,Unknown,There's chocolate and peanut butter and caramel in these sumbitches.
09x01,Unknown,"I call them ""Sumbitches""!"
09x01,Unknown,(laughing)
09x01,Unknown,And that's how Lily met your mother.
09x01,Unknown,Are Cousin Mitch and I directly related?
09x01,Unknown,"No, Mom, I'm asking is Cousin Mitch a blood relative?"
09x01,Unknown,"I'm not asking about Cousin Pete, I'm asking about Cousin Robin!"
09x01,Unknown,Mitch!
09x01,Unknown,Cousin Mitch!
09x01,Unknown,"Well, just find out from Uncle Frank and call me back!"
09x01,Unknown,"Well, then, go visit Cousin Cecil at his sky-diving school and ask him!"
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, God, he did?"
09x01,Unknown,"Well, I guess that can happen no matter how experienced you are."
09x01,Unknown,I'm so sorry.
09x01,Unknown,(exhales)
09x01,Unknown,My Cousin Cecil got fired.
09x01,(sighs),Oh.
09x01,Unknown,That's a relief. He was so distraught he jumped off the bridge. He's dead.
09x01,Unknown,Um... I'm so sorry for your loss.

09x01,Unknown,Oh. (laughs)
09x01,Unknown,This isn't an electronic device.

09x01,Unknown,"Please, I-I have to get to New York."
09x01,Unknown,"Yeah, well, you should have thought about that before you att*cked me."
09x01,Unknown,"All right, boys, you got this?"
09x01,Unknown,Good.
09x01,Unknown,"Let's get this bird in the air. Ah, you're both banned from this flight."
09x01,Unknown,"So I was driving with my friend, who thinks he',[/i] sThe Road Trip Master."""
09x01,Unknown,He has leather driving gloves.
09x01,Unknown,Who wears those?
09x01,Unknown,"Huge dorks, that's who."
09x01,Unknown,Your mother was lying.
09x01,Unknown,She had her own pair.
09x01,Unknown,And he always makes us stop to see some weird roadside attraction no one except him gives a crap about.
09x01,Unknown,Nerd alert.
09x01,Unknown,"Kids, you remember the seven-hour detour on our road trip to Disney World so your mother didn't miss that goat in South Carolina who could blow smoke rings."
09x01,Unknown,And he won't go one mile an hour over the speed limit.
09x01,Unknown,That would drive me crazy.
09x01,Unknown,I would give him a humiliating nickname until he stopped driving like a little girl.
09x01,NARRATOR,"It was ""Lady Tedwina Slowsby."""
09x01,Unknown,And it worked.

09x01,Unknown,You know.
09x01,Unknown,It's really not that big a deal.
09x01,Unknown,"Okay, we-we know we won't have kids."
09x01,Unknown,"And even if we did, King Joffrey's parents were brother and sister, and he was a fair and wise leader."
09x01,Unknown,"Yeah. Look, no one ever needs to know but us."
09x01,Unknown,Exactly.
09x01,Unknown,(both chuckle)
09x01,Unknown,I know.
09x01,Unknown,We might have to...
09x01,Unknown,Take care of Ranjit.
09x01,Unknown,"Hey, you just finished my..."
09x01,Unknown,Creepy telepathic m*rder thought.
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, it must be a soul mate thing."
09x01,Unknown,Unless... it's a weird cousin thing.
09x01,Unknown,(gags softly)
09x01,Unknown,"So we'll be good either way, right?"
09x01,Unknown,Honey?
09x01,Unknown,That's right... sweetie.
09x01,Unknown,"Now, get over here, you."

09x01,Unknown,"Ooh, mmm, mmm, mmm."

09x01,Unknown,I have got some naughty-naughty-naughty things planned.
09x01,Unknown,Aw.
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, wow, you have certainly piqued my incest."
09x01,Unknown,Interest. Interest!
09x01,Unknown,I still can't believe he dragged me to the childhood home of some stupid bucklesmith no one's ever even heard of.
09x01,Unknown,"Yeah, who cares about Florian van Otterloop?"
09x01,Unknown,I never told you his name.
09x01,Unknown,Sumbitch?
09x01,Unknown,"I mean, why'd he have to act that way?"
09x01,Unknown,He knows I hate how he gets on road trips.
09x01,Unknown,It almost seems like he wanted you to storm off.
09x01,Unknown,But we're going to the same place.
09x01,Unknown,There's no reason why he'd want to ditch me.
09x01,Unknown,"And suddenly Lily remembered that a week ago, I'd helped Robin look for her long-lost locket."
09x01,Unknown,But it was gone.
09x01,Unknown,"Then Lily told me the locket actually got stashed in my pencil box, but when I opened it... the locket wasn't there."
09x01,Unknown,Good.
09x01,Unknown,'Cause that locket's trouble.
09x01,Unknown,"How? It's-it's just a friendly, innocent wedding gift."
09x01,Unknown,It's not innocent.
09x01,Unknown,"Ted, you think if you can get that locket for Robin you'll win her back."
09x01,Unknown,"Lily, I've let it go."
09x01,Unknown,I mean... What?
09x01,Unknown,"There's, like, a one percent chance that Stella has the locket from when we lived together."
09x01,Unknown,Promise me you didn't call the woman who left you at the altar so that you could find that locket.
09x01,Unknown,Of course not.
09x01,Unknown,I e-mailed her.
09x01,Unknown,Ted.
09x01,Unknown,But Stella's living in L.A. now.
09x01,Unknown,"And even if she has it, it's buried in some storage unit."
09x01,Unknown,She said I'd have to fly out there and look for it myself.
09x01,Unknown,Promise me you aren't about to do that.
09x01,Unknown,I promise.
09x01,Unknown,Sumbitch!
09x01,Unknown,"You better hope when Sweaty finally gets off that phone, he can get me on the next flight to New York."
09x01,Unknown,I got the password from my mom.
09x01,Unknown,I'm gonna take that photo down myself.
09x01,Unknown,"You know, I don't give a damn about your photo."
09x01,Unknown,"My daughter is giving a big speech for the Model U.N. at her school, and I'm gonna miss it because of you."
09x01,Unknown,(sighs)
09x01,Unknown,Her father and I are separated.
09x01,Unknown,She lives with her dad.
09x01,Unknown,And if I don't make it... she's never gonna trust me again.
09x01,Unknown,I'm so sorry.
09x01,Unknown,"Wow, that worked on you?"
09x01,Unknown,Let's hope Pit Stains is as dumb as you are.
09x01,Unknown,What? Why is this so hard for my mom?
09x01,Unknown,"All you do is you click the photo, and then you click on the..."
09x01,Unknown,"I don't see... I don't see ""options."""
09x01,Unknown,"Just click on ""options."""

09x01,Unknown,"Hi, Grandma."
09x01,Unknown,You-you can explain how Cousin Mitch is related to us?
09x01,Unknown,"Explain, Grandma, explain!"
09x01,Unknown,"Okay, he married Barney's dad's cousin Renee, who he met selling Vachon cakes outside a curling bonspiel in Chicoutimi."
09x01,Unknown,"English, Grandma, English!"
09x01,Unknown,"And on our side of the family, he was adopted because his real parents were eaten alive by their sled dogs?"
09x01,Unknown,"That's awesome! Thanks, Grandma."
09x01,Unknown,(both sigh)
09x01,Unknown,So...
09x01,Unknown,So you and I share no DNA whatsoever.
09x01,Unknown,Let's change that.
09x01,Unknown,(both moaning)
09x01,RANJIT,Don't hold back.
09x01,Unknown,This divider is totally soundproof.
09x01,Unknown,Go all the way.
09x01,Unknown,Wait till the hotel?
09x01,Unknown,Totally.
09x01,Unknown,"Hey, you know what?"
09x01,Unknown,I'm not worried about a wild card at our wedding anymore.
09x01,Unknown,Whether it's Uncle Vic or Aunt Shelly or the ring bear.
09x01,Unknown,Ring bear-er. Er.
09x01,Unknown,"Whether any of those mammals go rogue, our wedding is gonna be legendary."
09x01,Unknown,"No ""wait for it""?"
09x01,Unknown,I've got you.
09x01,Unknown,I don't have to wait for it anymore.
09x01,Unknown,(phone ringing)
09x01,Unknown,(line ringing)
09x01,Unknown,"It's a long story, but if we don't beat my friend out to that wedding, it's gonna be bad."
09x01,Unknown,This is too stressful. I-I need to see Marvin!
09x01,Unknown,"No! You made me promise not to let you look, because it's only gonna upset you."
09x01,Unknown,"Here, have another sum... b*tch."
09x01,Unknown,No more sumbitches?!
09x01,Unknown,Give me the damn phone!
09x01,Unknown,(both scream)
09x01,Unknown,"(clamoring) Just go to ""edit"" on the toolbar!"
09x01,Unknown,"No, ""account settings""!"
09x01,Unknown,"Just click on ""options""!"
09x01,Unknown,Stop!
09x01,Unknown,It can't be done.
09x01,Unknown,That photo is etched in eternity.
09x01,Unknown,"Long after humanity's reign has ended, the only traces of our civilization found by Earth's new ape masters will be the top of the Statue of Liberty and this photo of me pretending to be a judge with a banana gavel."
09x01,Unknown,"Well, they'll probably like the banana thing."
09x01,Unknown,The ape masters?
09x01,Unknown,"Sorry. Lily's gonna see it, and we're gonna have the biggest fight of our lives."
09x01,Unknown,"(chuckles) Oh, I wish I could see your wife kick your ass."
09x01,Unknown,I don't mean a physical fight.
09x01,Unknown,She's not an animal.
09x01,Unknown,I'm sorry I tried to bite you.
09x01,Unknown,I'm sorry that I swatted you on the nose with a rolled-up magazine.
09x01,Unknown,It's the only way I'll learn.
09x01,Unknown,"Look, I haven't seen my baby in a week."
09x01,Unknown,You know what?
09x01,Unknown,Go for it.
09x01,Unknown,It's gone!
09x01,Unknown,It's gone!
09x01,Unknown,(all cheering)
09x01,Unknown,You did it!
09x01,Unknown,You did it! (laughs)

09x01,Unknown,(Lily yells)
09x01,Unknown,Lily! What the hell?!
09x01,Unknown,Ted and I had some road trip issues.
09x01,Unknown,Did he put on the gloves? Mm-hmm.
09x01,Unknown,That tackle was justified.
09x01,Unknown,What's this? It's for you.
09x01,Unknown,Don't open it.
09x01,TED,"With all the big changes coming up, I just wanted Robin to remember her friends."
09x01,Unknown,We all want nothing but happiness for you and Barney.
09x01,Unknown,"Right, Lily?"
09x01,Unknown,Right.
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, wow."
09x01,Unknown,"That was, what, eight years ago?"
09x01,Unknown,Yeah.
09x01,Unknown,Eight years.
09x01,Unknown,"Thanks, Ted."
09x01,Unknown,I'm gonna... I'm gonna get checked in.
09x01,Unknown,Marshall's flight just took off.
09x01,Unknown,My boys will be here soon.
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, yay."
09x01,Unknown,"Actually, Lily's boys were just learning there was only one more flight out to New York with one seat left, and it was all the way across the airport."
09x01,Unknown,"You're not gonna tackle me again, are you?"
09x01,Unknown,I'm the maid of honor.
09x01,Unknown,There's a good chance that won't be my only tackle of the weekend.
09x01,Unknown,It wasn't.
09x01,Unknown,"Look, I'm sorry."
09x01,Unknown,"I just got it in my head that you somehow managed to track down that locket in Los Angeles, and now you were gonna blow up the wedding."
09x01,Unknown,You really think I'm that crazy?
09x01,Unknown,(sighs)
09x01,Unknown,I guess that's fair.
09x01,Unknown,"Look, even though I was wrong, tell me you aren't thinking about doing anything insane this weekend."
09x01,Unknown,Of course not.
09x01,Unknown,"And all I can say, kids, is at that moment, I really thought I meant it."
09x01,Unknown,But the truth is... you never know who's gonna be the wild card at a wedding.
09x01,Unknown,"Hi. One ticket to Los Angeles, please."
09x01,Unknown,"That afternoon at the Farhampton Inn, Aunt Lily and I tried to check in."
09x01,Unknown,Are you chewing gum?
09x01,Unknown,You never chew gum.
09x01,Unknown,You shouldn't chew gum in here.
09x01,Unknown,"Nobody cares if I chew gum, Ted."
09x01,Unknown,Are you chewing gum?
09x01,Unknown,"Yes, she is. She's chewing gum."
09x01,Unknown,"Ooh, can I have a piece?"
09x01,Unknown,Of course! Great.
09x01,Unknown,Thank you.
09x01,Unknown,"Okay, let's chew some gum and get you guys all checked in."
09x01,Unknown,"Ms. Aldrin, how many keys will you need?"
09x01,Unknown,"Two, please."
09x01,Unknown,My husband's getting in later.
09x01,Unknown,"Excellent, and Mr. Mosby?"
09x01,Unknown,"Uh, just one, please."
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, oh, I-I see."
09x01,Unknown,Oh.
09x01,Unknown,"Well, hang in there."
09x01,Unknown,You'll find somebody.
09x01,Unknown,"Thank you, front desk stranger."
09x01,Unknown,"I'm sorry, we just... we just don't get a lot of singles here."
09x01,Unknown,"I mean, look at this place."
09x01,Unknown,It's so romantic.
09x01,Unknown,Countless babies conceived within these walls.
09x01,Unknown,And one... grisly m*rder.
09x01,Unknown,"Now, are you sure that you wouldn't feel more comfortable staying at a motel?"
09x01,Unknown,"What? No, look."
09x01,Unknown,"I'm not some miserable, lonely person."
09x01,Unknown,"Tell him, Lily."
09x01,Unknown,It's a tough weekend for him.
09x01,Unknown,Bro.
09x01,Unknown,We're here for a wedding. Ouch.
09x01,Unknown,"And he used to date the bride. Ooh, mama."
09x01,Unknown,And he's the best man. Devastating.
09x01,Unknown,Could you please just check us in?
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, your rooms aren't gonna be ready for hours."
09x01,Unknown,"But in the meantime, Ms. Aldrin, I definitely think you and your husband should check out the lighthouse."
09x01,Unknown,It's a beautiful view of the bay-- so romantic.
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, wow."
09x01,Unknown,Here's the channel guide for the TV.
09x01,Unknown,"Don't listen to him, Ted."
09x01,Unknown,(phone ringing)
09x01,Unknown,You are not alone.
09x01,Unknown,"In fact, this whole weekend, it is going to be nothing but me and..."
09x01,Unknown,Marshall!
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, thank God, you're on your way."
09x01,Unknown,"If I had to be here alone, I would k*ll myself."
09x01,Unknown,How are you doing?
09x01,Unknown,I'm fine... Curtis.
09x01,Unknown,"I mean, let's do the math here."
09x01,Unknown,"One ""best man"" plus on,[/i] eno girlfriend"" equals..."

09x01,Unknown,Marshall missed his flight.
09x01,Unknown,He might not get here tonight.
09x01,Unknown,He might not get here at all.

09x01,Unknown,"Okay, listen."

09x01,(Russian accent),What a wonderful night at the opera.

09x01,Unknown,Yep. Old Gypsy woman.
09x01,Unknown,"Good call, Barnovski. Oh, well, she's just a peasant."
09x01,Unknown,"Home, Smirnoff."
09x01,Unknown,"Wait, she's saying somethink!"
09x01,Unknown,"(low, deep moan)"
09x01,Unknown,Hornier.

09x01,Unknown,Hornier?
09x01,Unknown,Sonobovich!
09x01,Unknown,Did she just put a curse on us?

09x01,Unknown,"Okay, let's go, Smirnoff."
09x01,Unknown,Smirnoff?
09x01,Unknown,"Homina, hominovich. Mmm, Smirnoff, I would climb you like the Kremlin Wall."
09x01,Unknown,What's happening to me?
09x01,Unknown,"Don't you see? You're getting hornier, brother, just like the old Gypsy woman said!"
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, hello there."
09x01,Unknown,(chuckles) Ever had a White Russian?
09x01,Unknown,"For the next 200 years, every male member of the Stinson family was afflicted by the Gypsy's curse, an unquenchable thirst for booty"
09x01,Unknown,that no committed relationship
09x01,Unknown,could ever satisfy.
09x01,Unknown,"That is, until my brother James met his husband Tom."
09x01,Unknown,"The day they got married, they lifted the curse forever, freeing me from the shackles of having sex with lots of different women."
09x01,Unknown,"Although, sometimes Robin and I still use the shackles."
09x01,Unknown,Bondage five!
09x01,Unknown,"Whoa. I can't, I can't, I can't."

09x01,Unknown,Ah.
09x01,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x01,Unknown,This is worse than I thought.
09x01,Unknown,"I know. Showtime, no HBO?"
09x01,JAMES,No.
09x01,Unknown,Tom and I are getting divorced.
09x01,What? TED,What?
09x01,Unknown,That's why you look extra handsome.
09x01,Unknown,I do get extra hot when I'm single.
09x01,Unknown,Your skin looks amazing.
09x01,Unknown,Looks amazing. I know.
09x01,Unknown,So... so what happened? Why-why'd you guys break up?
09x01,Unknown,"Well, the thing to remember is that when something like this happens, it's nobody's fault."
09x01,Unknown,You cheated on him. Repeatedly.
09x01,Unknown,"I thought about keeping it quiet, but then I realized, wouldn't my family want me to be honest with them about news this big?"
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, can I just say five things?"
09x01,Unknown,"What is the matter with... sorry, six-- you?!"
09x01,Unknown,Ooh! What?!
09x01,Unknown,"I'm-I'm sorry about you and Tom, but you can't just drop a bombshell like this so close to someone's wedding."
09x01,Unknown,You broke the curse. You and Tom are the only couple that makes Barney believe in marriage.
09x01,Unknown,(chuckles) Really? The only couple?
09x01,Unknown,"I mean, no one else comes to mind?"
09x01,Unknown,Been together 17 years?
09x01,Unknown,"She's a spunky redhead, he's got calves that launched a thousand lady boners?"
09x01,BARNEY,"Hey, sorry about that."
09x01,Unknown,"Hey, did you guys know that Sunday is James' and Tom's anniversary?"
09x01,Unknown,How cool is that?
09x01,Unknown,We're anniversary bros!
09x01,Unknown,"Every year, we should go out and celebrate... just the two of us."
09x01,Unknown,"Listen, bro, you..."
09x01,Unknown,"I know, I know, ""Please, Barney, you don't have to get us an anniversary gift this year."""
09x01,Unknown,You get them an anniversary gift?
09x01,Unknown,Why shouldn't I? They're the one couple that makes me believe marriage is possible.
09x01,Unknown,"I mean, I'm sitting right here."
09x01,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x01,JAMES,"Barney, the thing is..."
09x01,Unknown,"Cover your ears and hum ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic."""
09x01,Unknown,Why?
09x01,Unknown,It's for the bride.
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, it's for... (humming)"
09x01,Unknown,"Okay, listen, James, my cousin Vince is a Mountie."
09x01,Unknown,"His girlfriend is back home, but he gets gay at weddings."
09x01,Unknown,He's yours. I am giving you Vince.
09x01,Unknown,"Just please, don't tell Barney."
09x01,Unknown,If he finds out that the only successful marriage in his life is over...
09x01,Unknown,I hate everyone at this table.
09x01,Unknown,...it'll spook him.
09x01,Unknown,I don't want him getting spooked.
09x01,Unknown,"Robin, have some faith."
09x01,Unknown,Do you really think what you and Barney have is that fragile?
09x01,Unknown,I don't want to find out.
09x01,Unknown,Fine.
09x01,Unknown,"Thanks, baby."
09x01,Unknown,No sweat. Mmm...
09x01,Unknown,"So, James, seriously, where's Tom?"
09x01,Unknown,He can't make the wedding.
09x01,Unknown,He had his wisdom teeth out.
09x01,Unknown,Ugh! On top of a divorce?
09x01,Unknown,That is rough.
09x01,Unknown,Uh-oh.
09x01,Unknown,What is she talking about?
09x01,Unknown,Tom and I are getting a divorce.
09x01,Unknown,Excuse me.
09x01,Unknown,Vince... off the table.
09x01,Unknown,What was that? I don't know.
09x01,Unknown,It just came out.
09x01,Unknown,That's it. It's barely even noon.
09x01,Unknown,You're cut off.
09x01,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x01,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x01,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x01,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x01,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x01,Unknown,"Okay, but after that one, you're cut off!"
09x01,Unknown,"No! No, you are not doing this. Step away from the desk."
09x01,Unknown,What are you talking about?
09x01,Unknown,"You just found out about James and Tom, and it totally freaked you out, and now you're asking this guy to point you in the direction of the nearest, dirtiest strip club."
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, well, that-that's a tough one."
09x01,Unknown,"Uh, the nearest one that's-that's kind of dirty is The Sand Box, but the, uh... the dirtiest one that's nearby is The Crab Shed."
09x01,Unknown,Dude.
09x01,Unknown,"Sorry. Uh, but hey, if-if you do go, maybe you could take Ted."
09x01,Unknown,I'm really worried about that kid.
09x01,Unknown,"No, Robin, I am not going to a strip club."
09x01,Unknown,Especially right now.
09x01,Unknown,Could you imagine the day shift at The Crab Shed?
09x01,Unknown,Robin...
09x01,Unknown,I came to the desk to get this.
09x01,Unknown,Is that the key to our room?
09x01,Unknown,It's the key to James's room.
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, my."
09x01,Unknown,What is that?
09x01,Unknown,It's an erotic cake.
09x01,Unknown,I wanted to surprise them for their anniversary.
09x01,Unknown,Is that... is that James and Tom?
09x01,Unknown,"Mmm, caramel marzipan, chocolate marzipan."
09x01,Unknown,I love chocolate marzipan.
09x01,Unknown,So does Tom. Used to anyway.
09x01,Unknown,"This is, uh, absolutely the, uh... the weirdest thing anyone has ever done for their sibling."
09x01,Unknown,I love you so much.
09x01,Unknown,You thought I was gonna freak out.
09x01,Unknown,"Well, I mean, a Gypsy cursed your family to become hornier and do awesome guitar solos."
09x01,Unknown,Can you blame me?
09x01,Unknown,"Look, am I bummed about James and Tom getting a divorce?"
09x01,Unknown,Obviously. But I don't need them to make me believe in true love anymore.
09x01,Unknown,I've got you for that now.
09x01,Unknown,Mmm.
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, man, now I gotta figure out what to do with all this stuff."
09x01,Unknown,"Well, before we do that... um, would it be all right if I nibbled on your brother's Ding Dong?"
09x01,Unknown,How about we nibble on my brother's Ding Dong together?
09x01,Unknown,I'd like that.
09x01,NARRATOR,"So, they cleaned all that stuff"
09x01,Unknown,out of there and had a talk with James.
09x01,Unknown,"And Barney didn't freak out,"

09x01,Unknown,Daphne picks the music.

09x01,Unknown,"Oh, yeah. I can see it."
09x01,Unknown,"Nursing your gin and tonic with three extra limes, doing the crossword, probably being all showboat-y about it."
09x01,Unknown,I wasn't being showboat-y about it.
09x01,Unknown,"""Vesuvius""! Boo-yah!"
09x01,Unknown,"Oh, wait, that doesn't fit."
09x01,Unknown,"The point is, one year ago today, I made a promise to myself right at this table."
09x01,THE MOTHER,What was the promise?
09x01,BOTH TEDS,"I'm coming back, and I'm bringing you."

09x01,Unknown,It gets better.
09x01,Unknown,"I am fine, Curtis. Okay?"
09x01,Unknown,I enjoy and appreciate the happiness of other people whether I am in a relationship or not. Okay? Curtis?
09x01,Unknown,So just-just... just go ahead and give me my one key because I am fine.

09x02,Unknown,"Look, I'm happy to rock it up into the 50s, but I'm gonna need a hand... or two."
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, no. Not the driving gloves."
09x02,Unknown,"In 99.9% of highway accidents, the driver was not wearing gloves."
09x02,Unknown,Because they're stupid.
09x02,Unknown,They don't help you drive better.
09x02,Unknown,That's why no one wears them.
09x02,Unknown,Then why is it called... the glove compartment?
09x02,Unknown,I am not having this argument again.

09x02,Unknown,I promise.
09x02,Unknown,Sumbitch!
09x02,Unknown,"You better hope when Sweaty finally gets off that phone, he can get me on the next flight to New York."
09x02,Unknown,I got the password from my mom.
09x02,Unknown,I'm gonna take that photo down myself.
09x02,Unknown,"You know, I don't give a damn about your photo."
09x02,Unknown,"My daughter is giving a big speech for the Model U.N. at her school, and I'm gonna miss it because of you."
09x02,Unknown,(sighs)
09x02,Unknown,Her father and I are separated.
09x02,Unknown,She lives with her dad.
09x02,Unknown,And if I don't make it... she's never gonna trust me again.
09x02,Unknown,I'm so sorry.
09x02,Unknown,"Wow, that worked on you?"
09x02,Unknown,Let's hope Pit Stains is as dumb as you are.
09x02,Unknown,What? Why is this so hard for my mom?
09x02,Unknown,"All you do is you click the photo, and then you click on the..."
09x02,Unknown,"I don't see... I don't see ""options."""
09x02,Unknown,"Just click on ""options."""

09x02,Unknown,You-you can explain how Cousin Mitch is related to us?
09x02,Unknown,"Explain, Grandma, explain!"
09x02,Unknown,"Okay, he married Barney's dad's cousin Renee, who he met selling Vachon cakes outside a curling bonspiel in Chicoutimi."
09x02,Unknown,"English, Grandma, English!"
09x02,Unknown,"And on our side of the family, he was adopted because his real parents were eaten alive by their sled dogs?"
09x02,Unknown,"That's awesome! Thanks, Grandma."
09x02,Unknown,(both sigh)
09x02,Unknown,So...
09x02,Unknown,So you and I share no DNA whatsoever.

09x02,Unknown,I'm not worried about a wild card at our wedding anymore.
09x02,Unknown,Whether it's Uncle Vic or Aunt Shelly or the ring bear.
09x02,Unknown,Ring bear-er. Er.

09x02,Unknown,The ape masters?
09x02,Unknown,"Sorry. Lily's gonna see it, and we're gonna have the biggest fight of our lives."
09x02,Unknown,"(chuckles) Oh, I wish I could see your wife kick your ass."
09x02,Unknown,I don't mean a physical fight.
09x02,Unknown,She's not an animal.
09x02,Unknown,I'm sorry I tried to bite you.
09x02,Unknown,I'm sorry that I swatted you on the nose with a rolled-up magazine.
09x02,Unknown,It's the only way I'll learn.
09x02,Unknown,"Look, I haven't seen my baby in a week."
09x02,Unknown,You know what?
09x02,Unknown,Go for it.

09x02,Unknown,Lily! What the hell?!
09x02,Unknown,Ted and I had some road trip issues.
09x02,Unknown,Did he put on the gloves? Mm-hmm.
09x02,Unknown,That tackle was justified.
09x02,Unknown,What's this? It's for you.
09x02,Unknown,Don't open it.
09x02,TED,"With all the big changes coming up, I just wanted Robin to remember her friends."
09x02,Unknown,We all want nothing but happiness for you and Barney.
09x02,Unknown,"Right, Lily?"
09x02,Unknown,Right.
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, wow."
09x02,Unknown,"That was, what, eight years ago?"
09x02,Unknown,Yeah.
09x02,Unknown,Eight years.
09x02,Unknown,"Thanks, Ted."
09x02,Unknown,I'm gonna... I'm gonna get checked in.
09x02,Unknown,Marshall's flight just took off.
09x02,Unknown,My boys will be here soon.
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, yay."
09x02,Unknown,"Actually, Lily's boys were just learning there was only one more flight out to New York with one seat left, and it was all the way across the airport."
09x02,Unknown,"You're not gonna tackle me again, are you?"
09x02,Unknown,I'm the maid of honor.
09x02,Unknown,There's a good chance that won't be my only tackle of the weekend.
09x02,Unknown,It wasn't.
09x02,Unknown,"Look, I'm sorry."
09x02,Unknown,"I just got it in my head that you somehow managed to track down that locket in Los Angeles, and now you were gonna blow up the wedding."
09x02,Unknown,You really think I'm that crazy?
09x02,Unknown,(sighs)
09x02,Unknown,I guess that's fair.
09x02,Unknown,"Look, even though I was wrong, tell me you aren't thinking about doing anything insane this weekend."
09x02,Unknown,Of course not.
09x02,Unknown,"And all I can say, kids, is at that moment, I really thought I meant it."
09x02,Unknown,But the truth is... you never know who's gonna be the wild card at a wedding.
09x02,Unknown,"Hi. One ticket to Los Angeles, please."
09x02,Unknown,"That afternoon at the Farhampton Inn, Aunt Lily and I tried to check in."
09x02,Unknown,Are you chewing gum?
09x02,Unknown,You never chew gum.
09x02,Unknown,You shouldn't chew gum in here.
09x02,Unknown,"Nobody cares if I chew gum, Ted."
09x02,Unknown,Are you chewing gum?
09x02,Unknown,"Yes, she is. She's chewing gum."
09x02,Unknown,"Ooh, can I have a piece?"
09x02,Unknown,Of course! Great.
09x02,Unknown,Thank you.
09x02,Unknown,"Okay, let's chew some gum and get you guys all checked in."
09x02,Unknown,"Ms. Aldrin, how many keys will you need?"
09x02,Unknown,"Two, please."
09x02,Unknown,My husband's getting in later.
09x02,Unknown,"Excellent, and Mr. Mosby?"
09x02,Unknown,"Uh, just one, please."
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, oh, I-I see."
09x02,Unknown,Oh.
09x02,Unknown,"Well, hang in there."
09x02,Unknown,You'll find somebody.
09x02,Unknown,"Thank you, front desk stranger."
09x02,Unknown,"I'm sorry, we just... we just don't get a lot of singles here."
09x02,Unknown,"I mean, look at this place."
09x02,Unknown,It's so romantic.
09x02,Unknown,Countless babies conceived within these walls.
09x02,Unknown,And one... grisly m*rder.
09x02,Unknown,"Now, are you sure that you wouldn't feel more comfortable staying at a motel?"
09x02,Unknown,"What? No, look."
09x02,Unknown,"I'm not some miserable, lonely person."
09x02,Unknown,"Tell him, Lily."
09x02,Unknown,It's a tough weekend for him.
09x02,Unknown,Bro.
09x02,Unknown,We're here for a wedding. Ouch.
09x02,Unknown,"And he used to date the bride. Ooh, mama."
09x02,Unknown,And he's the best man. Devastating.
09x02,Unknown,Could you please just check us in?
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, your rooms aren't gonna be ready for hours."
09x02,Unknown,"But in the meantime, Ms. Aldrin, I definitely think you and your husband should check out the lighthouse."
09x02,Unknown,It's a beautiful view of the bay-- so romantic.
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, wow."
09x02,Unknown,Here's the channel guide for the TV.
09x02,Unknown,"Don't listen to him, Ted."

09x02,Unknown,You get them an anniversary gift?
09x02,Unknown,Why shouldn't I? They're the one couple that makes me believe marriage is possible.
09x02,Unknown,"I mean, I'm sitting right here."
09x02,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x02,JAMES,"Barney, the thing is..."

09x02,Unknown,Why?
09x02,Unknown,It's for the bride.
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, it's for... (humming)"
09x02,Unknown,"Okay, listen, James, my cousin Vince is a Mountie."
09x02,Unknown,"His girlfriend is back home, but he gets gay at weddings."
09x02,Unknown,He's yours. I am giving you Vince.
09x02,Unknown,"Just please, don't tell Barney."
09x02,Unknown,If he finds out that the only successful marriage in his life is over...
09x02,Unknown,I hate everyone at this table.
09x02,Unknown,...it'll spook him.
09x02,Unknown,I don't want him getting spooked.
09x02,Unknown,"Robin, have some faith."
09x02,Unknown,Do you really think what you and Barney have is that fragile?
09x02,Unknown,I don't want to find out.
09x02,Unknown,Fine.
09x02,Unknown,"Thanks, baby."
09x02,Unknown,No sweat. Mmm...
09x02,Unknown,"So, James, seriously, where's Tom?"
09x02,Unknown,He can't make the wedding.
09x02,Unknown,He had his wisdom teeth out.
09x02,Unknown,Ugh! On top of a divorce?
09x02,Unknown,That is rough.
09x02,Unknown,Uh-oh.
09x02,Unknown,What is she talking about?
09x02,Unknown,Tom and I are getting a divorce.
09x02,Unknown,Excuse me.
09x02,Unknown,Vince... off the table.
09x02,Unknown,What was that? I don't know.
09x02,Unknown,It just came out.
09x02,Unknown,That's it. It's barely even noon.
09x02,Unknown,You're cut off.
09x02,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x02,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x02,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x02,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x02,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x02,Unknown,"Okay, but after that one, you're cut off!"
09x02,Unknown,"No! No, you are not doing this. Step away from the desk."
09x02,Unknown,What are you talking about?
09x02,Unknown,"You just found out about James and Tom, and it totally freaked you out, and now you're asking this guy to point you in the direction of the nearest, dirtiest strip club."
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, well, that-that's a tough one."
09x02,Unknown,"Uh, the nearest one that's-that's kind of dirty is The Sand Box, but the, uh... the dirtiest one that's nearby is The Crab Shed."
09x02,Unknown,Dude.
09x02,Unknown,"Sorry. Uh, but hey, if-if you do go, maybe you could take Ted."
09x02,Unknown,I'm really worried about that kid.
09x02,Unknown,"No, Robin, I am not going to a strip club."
09x02,Unknown,Especially right now.
09x02,Unknown,Could you imagine the day shift at The Crab Shed?
09x02,Unknown,Robin...
09x02,Unknown,I came to the desk to get this.
09x02,Unknown,Is that the key to our room?
09x02,Unknown,It's the key to James's room.
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, my."
09x02,Unknown,What is that?
09x02,Unknown,It's an erotic cake.
09x02,Unknown,I wanted to surprise them for their anniversary.
09x02,Unknown,Is that... is that James and Tom?
09x02,Unknown,"Mmm, caramel marzipan, chocolate marzipan."
09x02,Unknown,I love chocolate marzipan.
09x02,Unknown,So does Tom. Used to anyway.
09x02,Unknown,"This is, uh, absolutely the, uh... the weirdest thing anyone has ever done for their sibling."
09x02,Unknown,I love you so much.
09x02,Unknown,You thought I was gonna freak out.
09x02,Unknown,"Well, I mean, a Gypsy cursed your family to become hornier and do awesome guitar solos."
09x02,Unknown,Can you blame me?
09x02,Unknown,"Look, am I bummed about James and Tom getting a divorce?"
09x02,Unknown,Obviously. But I don't need them to make me believe in true love anymore.
09x02,Unknown,I've got you for that now.
09x02,Unknown,Mmm.
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, man, now I gotta figure out what to do with all this stuff."
09x02,Unknown,"Well, before we do that... um, would it be all right if I nibbled on your brother's Ding Dong?"
09x02,Unknown,How about we nibble on my brother's Ding Dong together?
09x02,Unknown,I'd like that.
09x02,NARRATOR,"So, they cleaned all that stuff"
09x02,Unknown,out of there and had a talk with James.
09x02,Unknown,"And Barney didn't freak out,"
09x02,Unknown,"because here's the thing, kids."
09x02,Unknown,"When you believe in people, people come through."
09x02,Unknown,"Just so we're clear, I pick the music."
09x02,Unknown,Of course.
09x02,Unknown,Say it.
09x02,Unknown,"Say, ""Daphne picks the music."""
09x02,Unknown,Daphne picks the music.
09x02,Unknown,And you pay for gas.
09x02,Unknown,Are you kidding? Do you have any idea how much gas this thing takes?
09x02,Unknown,(engine revs)
09x02,Unknown,"No, no, okay!"
09x02,Unknown,"Okay, I pay for gas."
09x02,Unknown,"Good. Now, get in."
09x02,Unknown,It's a long ride to Phoenix.
09x02,Unknown,Say what?
09x02,Unknown,(laughs)
09x02,Unknown,I'm just kidding.
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, this is gonna be fun."
09x02,Unknown,This must be the singles table.

09x02,Unknown,Guess it is.

09x02,Unknown,I don't know.
09x02,Unknown,"I'm trying to be happy for my brother, but, uh... I guess a person has a different perspective on weddings when he knows what's down there at the end of the aisle."
09x02,Unknown,It's not all champagne and frosting.
09x02,Unknown,"Mr. Stinson, your room is ready."
09x02,Unknown,"And, Ted... she's right around the corner."

09x02,Unknown,She's in the room that's right around the corner from yours.
09x02,Unknown,"Oh. So another hour, tops."
09x02,Unknown,Sure.
09x02,Unknown,"Okay, see you later, Ted."

09x02,Unknown,I just ate a croissant crumb that I found in my bra.

09x02,Unknown,"Hey, you want to hear something funny?"
09x02,Unknown,Mm-hmm.

09x02,Unknown,"Oh, yeah. I can see it."
09x02,Unknown,"Nursing your gin and tonic with three extra limes, doing the crossword, probably being all showboat-y about it."
09x02,Unknown,I wasn't being showboat-y about it.
09x02,Unknown,"""Vesuvius"""" Boo-yah!"
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, wait, that doesn't fit."
09x02,Unknown,"The point is, one year ago today, I made a promise to myself right at this table."

09x02,Unknown,I did.
09x02,Unknown,"Okay, seriously, what the crap is taking so long with these rooms?"
09x02,Unknown,It was like this last year.
09x02,Unknown,I'll be right back.
09x02,Unknown,I'll be right here.

09x02,Unknown,It gets better.
09x02,Unknown,"I am fine, Curtis. Okay?"
09x02,Unknown,I enjoy and appreciate the happiness of other people whether I am in a relationship or not. Okay? Curtis?
09x02,Unknown,So just-just... just go ahead and give me my one key because I am fine.
09x02,Unknown,"Oh, come on! I need another drink."
09x03,Unknown,"So, the hairdresser shows up"

09x03,Unknown,60 years.
09x03,Unknown,"Man, when was the last time you think they had sex?"
09x03,Unknown,Probably not since the Maple Leafs won the cup.
09x03,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x03,Unknown,1967.
09x03,Unknown,"That's not gonna be us, right?"
09x03,Unknown,"Like, when we get married, it's not all fighting, no sex?"
09x03,Unknown,What? No way.

09x03,Unknown,There's got to be someplace to bang around here.
09x03,Unknown,I'm starving.
09x03,Unknown,I knew we should've hit the buffet when...
09x03,Unknown,(grunts)
09x03,Unknown,"Don't say ""buffet""."
09x03,Unknown,"That attracts old people. Same goes for ""coupon,"""
09x03,Unknown,"""60 Minutes"" and ""Mandy Patinkin."""
09x03,Unknown,"W... Robin, you're being paranoid."
09x03,Unknown,"Old people don't magically sense it when you say ""Mandy Patinkin."""
09x03,(echoing whisper),Patinkin...
09x03,Unknown,"Quick, the ice machine room."
09x03,Unknown,It's too cold for them in there. Oh.
09x03,Unknown,"I'll protect you, Robin."
09x03,Unknown,You'll always be safe with me.
09x03,Unknown,(screams)
09x03,Unknown,Take her!
09x03,Unknown,You b*tches best get out of my hiding spot.
09x03,Unknown,"The only thing not checked off on this list i,[/i] sscotch with Barney."" That's the easiest one on here."
09x03,Unknown,You
09x03,Unknown,are
09x03,Unknown,avoiding him.
09x03,Unknown,I'm not. We've both been busy.
09x03,Unknown,"Besides, Marshall and I are saving that scotch to have a drink with Barney before the rehearsal dinner."
09x03,Unknown,Because it's not just any bottle.
09x03,Unknown,It's a $600
09x03,Unknown,Glen McKenna 30-year.
09x03,Unknown,What I didn't know at the time was...
09x03,Unknown,I told those idiots these death rods are not welcome here.
09x03,Unknown,What is it with dudes and swords?
09x03,Unknown,"Oh, this is fun."
09x03,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, and it's so cool when I go like this."
09x03,Unknown,Hi. My name is Rodrigo DeGoya.
09x03,Unknown,You k*lled someone I love!
09x03,Unknown,Prepare to dance!
09x03,Unknown,"Yes, kids, that's what your Aunt Lily thought the line was."
09x03,Unknown,(growls)
09x03,Unknown,Ha! Whoo!
09x03,Unknown,(both grunting)
09x03,Unknown,Ha!
09x03,Unknown,(both gasp)
09x03,Unknown,We'll switch it with this cheap bottle of whiskey.
09x03,Unknown,You peel the label off the Glen McKenna.
09x03,Unknown,On it!
09x03,Unknown,Then we'll pour the... Robin!
09x03,Unknown,"Damn, that's smooth."
09x03,Unknown,Pour it into the other bottle!
09x03,Unknown,Wait. The color's not dark enough.
09x03,Unknown,Still not right.
09x03,Unknown,I think it was a little redder. Mm-hmm.
09x03,Unknown,"Okay, now the consistency's off."
09x03,Unknown,(sighs)
09x03,Unknown,Yeah.
09x03,Unknown,Looks good.
09x03,Unknown,"I mean, look at the color."
09x03,Unknown,It's almost chocolaty in its richness.
09x03,Unknown,The reddish hue.
09x03,Unknown,Something that looks sort of clumpy.
09x03,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, I-I read about that."
09x03,Unknown,Isn't the Highland region known for its clumps?
09x03,Unknown,"Thanks, Lily."
09x03,Unknown,I'm very aware of the Highland Clumps.
09x03,Unknown,You know what? I think I'm gonna sneak a taste.
09x03,Unknown,What? But-but Marshall's not even here yet!
09x03,Unknown,"Ah, a quick nip won't hurt."
09x03,Unknown,Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
09x03,Unknown,(sniffs)
09x03,Unknown,She's breathtaking.
09x03,Unknown,"You avoiding the family, too?"
09x03,Unknown,"I'm gay, I'm black, and I'm getting a divorce."
09x03,Unknown,Those walking skeletons are gonna have more questions for me than their pharmacist.
09x03,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x03,Unknown,But they're family and I love 'em.
09x03,Unknown,The greatest generation.
09x03,Unknown,Smother me before I'm that age. (laughs)
09x03,Unknown,What are you two doing?
09x03,Unknown,"Oh, we're trying to do it someplace naughty."
09x03,Unknown,(gasps)
09x03,Unknown,Not what I mean!
09x03,Unknown,That-that is never what I mean!
09x03,Unknown,(sighs)
09x03,Unknown,We're trying to sneak in one last bang 'cause we're afraid that the magic might fade after we get married.
09x03,Unknown,Are we being crazy?
09x03,Unknown,That is what happened with me and Tom.
09x03,Unknown,But it doesn't mean it's gonna happen to you.
09x03,Unknown,I won't let it.
09x03,Unknown,"Whoa-whoa, you can't go out there."
09x03,Unknown,It's su1c1de.
09x03,Unknown,Consider it your early wedding gift.
09x03,Unknown,Why does the brother always die first?
09x03,Unknown,Aunt Muriel!
09x03,Unknown,Aunt Muriel!
09x03,Unknown,Aunt Muriel?
09x03,Unknown,James!
09x03,Unknown,Where's Tom?
09x03,Unknown,I have a gay question for you.
09x03,Unknown,How do you decide which one...?
09x03,Unknown,"No, no..."
09x03,Unknown,"No! He's gone, Barney. He's gone."
09x03,Unknown,James!
09x03,Unknown,"Okay, you go check out the second floor for open rooms."
09x03,Unknown,I'm gonna go check out the gym.
09x03,Unknown,"No, no, no, that gym has a sauna!"
09x03,Unknown,You know my Papa Sid can't go ten minutes without a schvitz!
09x03,Unknown,What about the gazebo out back?
09x03,Unknown,Next to the lawn bowling court?
09x03,Unknown,Get your head out of your ass.
09x03,Unknown,It looks like they're casting
09x03,Unknown,Cocoon Three
09x03,Unknown,out there.
09x03,Unknown,"Oh, what about the business center?"
09x03,Unknown,A room full of computers? That's perfect.
09x03,Unknown,Technology is their compression-sock-covered Achilles Heel!
09x03,Unknown,Whoa. What?
09x03,Unknown,"Stay safe, R-Train. You too, B-Nasty."
09x03,Unknown,Mmm... Mmm...
09x03,Unknown,Ah!
09x03,Unknown,"Ooh, my, I found Waldo."
09x03,Unknown,(laughs)
09x03,Unknown,What's this list?
09x03,Unknown,Whose is this?
09x03,NARRATOR,I was faced with a tough call:
09x03,Unknown,come clean about Chicago or cleverly lie my way out of it.
09x03,Unknown,"Oh, well, you see... mouth words... memory times..."
09x03,Unknown,It's mine. It's my list.
09x03,Unknown,It's everything I want to do before I go to Italy.
09x03,Unknown,Oh. You want to say good-bye to the Empire State Building?
09x03,Unknown,Sometimes I go and I talk to Empy.
09x03,Unknown,That's kind of weird.
09x03,Unknown,"Is ""weird"" the right word?"
09x03,Unknown,Seems pretty reasonable to me.
09x03,Unknown,Maybe even kind of cool.
09x03,Unknown,"""Have a drink with my favorite students."""
09x03,Unknown,"Lily, you taught kindergarten."
09x03,Unknown,That does seem pretty irresponsible.
09x03,Unknown,"""Come clean about April 26."""
09x03,Unknown,You told Ted about our sword fight?
09x03,Unknown,Wait-- you-you guys had a sword fight?
09x03,Unknown,Maybe a tiny one.
09x03,Unknown,I was pretending to be Mandy Patinkin.
09x03,(echoing whisper),Patinkin.
09x03,Unknown,But it was no big deal.
09x03,Unknown,No big deal?
09x03,Unknown,"We destroyed their 30-year Glen McKenna and replaced it with cheap booze, ketchup and hand sanny."
09x03,Unknown,I knew it!
09x03,Unknown,You knew nothing!
09x03,Unknown,(phone rings)
09x03,Unknown,Hello.
09x03,Unknown,"The third floor's a ghost town, tons of empty rooms to bang in."
09x03,Unknown,Hurry. I've started without you.
09x03,Unknown,"I mean, I love you."
09x03,Unknown,Got to go.
09x03,Unknown,Bye.
09x03,Unknown,(sighs)
09x03,Unknown,We made it.
09x03,Unknown,(both laugh)
09x03,Unknown,(both moaning)
09x03,MURIEL,"Remind me to put a five-dollar bill in Barney's wedding card, you know, to get 'em started."
09x03,Unknown,(giggles)
09x03,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x03,MAN,"No, Elizabeth."
09x03,Unknown,Leave the dentures in.
09x03,WOMAN,Mmm!
09x03,BOTH,I never want to have sex again.
09x03,Unknown,Aw.
09x03,Unknown,(groans)
09x03,Unknown,They broke our $600 bottle of scotch?
09x03,Unknown,"Well, I'm not wearing this abomination anymore."
09x03,Unknown,Put it back on.
09x03,Unknown,I can't believe my great-grandparents still do that.
09x03,Unknown,I never imagined a walker being used for anything other than walking.
09x03,Unknown,"Plus, how about those balls dragging all over the ground?"
09x03,Unknown,Barney.
09x03,Unknown,"No, the tennis balls on the bottom of the walker."
09x03,Unknown,Oh.
09x03,Unknown,"Plus, his testicles were swinging like a broken yo-yo."
09x03,"Still, when you think about it",married for 60 years and they still want to jump each other's bones.
09x03,Unknown,I mean... it's kind of sweet.
09x03,Unknown,"In 60 years,"
09x03,Unknown,that
09x03,Unknown,"'ll be us, right?"
09x03,Unknown,"Yeah, it will."
09x03,Unknown,(both chuckle)
09x03,Unknown,"So, what do you think, hmm?"
09x03,Unknown,On the count of three?
09x03,Unknown,"Hmm, okay."
09x03,Unknown,Okay.
09x03,BOTH,"One, two, three."
09x03,Unknown,Mandy Patinkin.
09x03,Unknown,"Oh, wow. Look at you."
09x03,Unknown,Thank you for making it...
09x03,Unknown,We got lucky.
09x03,Unknown,The Farhampton Liquor Store is actually pretty high-end.
09x03,Unknown,Oh.
09x03,Unknown,And their security is a total joke.
09x03,Unknown,Thanks.
09x03,Unknown,And thanks for not telling Robin the list was mine.
09x03,Unknown,But I don't get it.
09x03,Unknown,You're so against me moving.
09x03,Unknown,Why'd you help me out?
09x03,Unknown,(sighs)
09x03,Unknown,"For a guy who loves New York this much, to leave it, you must really need to go, huh?"
09x03,Unknown,"Yeah, I really do."
09x03,Unknown,"Okay, but there's still one item left on this list."
09x03,Unknown,Time to check it off.
09x03,Unknown,"Yeah, I should probably wait for Marshall."
09x03,Unknown,"Well, we both know he may not get here in time."
09x03,Unknown,Be honest.
09x03,Unknown,Have you been avoiding Barney?
09x03,Unknown,Maybe a little.
09x03,Unknown,"This is the biggest weekend of his life, and you're his best bro."
09x03,Unknown,"No matter how awkward you feel, i-if you're not there for him, you will always regret it."
09x03,Unknown,Okay.
09x03,Unknown,"Hey, Ted. Yeah."
09x03,Unknown,"You wrote down all these things to say good-bye to, but so many of them are good things."
09x03,Unknown,Why not just... say good-bye to the bad things?
09x03,Unknown,Say good-bye to all the times you felt lost.
09x03,Unknown,To all the times it was a no instead of a yes.
09x03,Unknown,"To all the scrapes and bruises,"
09x03,Unknown,to all the heartache.
09x03,Unknown,"Say good-bye to everything you really want to do for the last time,"
09x03,Unknown,but don't go have one last scotch with Barney.
09x03,Unknown,"Have the first scotch toasting Barney's new life because that's a good thing, and the good things will always be here waiting for you."
09x03,Unknown,What?
09x03,Unknown,Turn the page.
09x03,Unknown,"""Get one last life lecture from Lily."""
09x03,Unknown,"Well, you're dreaming if you think that's the last one of those."
09x03,Unknown,(sighs)
09x03,Unknown,Ah.
09x03,Unknown,"Been waiting for the perfect time for this, and, my friend, that time is..."
09x03,Unknown,I saw you and Robin at the carousel.
09x04,Unknown,"Kids, it was two days before Barney and Robin's wedding, and everything was going off without a hitch."
09x04,TED,Ah.
09x04,Unknown,"Been waiting for the perfect time for this, and, my friend, that time is..."
09x04,Unknown,I saw you and Robin at the carousel.
09x04,Unknown,(bottle shatters)
09x04,Unknown,"Okay, there was one slight hitch."
09x04,Unknown,"She called me to help her, and there you were in the rain holding hands with my fiancée."
09x04,Unknown,What up?
09x04,Unknown,Nothing up.
09x04,Unknown,Everything down.
09x04,Unknown,All parts of me down.
09x04,Unknown,"Look, you were busy, so I-I..."
09x04,Unknown,I went to the park to help her look for this locket she buried years ago.
09x04,Unknown,"She couldn't find it, she got upset, I held her hand. End of story."
09x04,Unknown,Cool! I just wanted to air that out.
09x04,Unknown,"You know, bro to bro."
09x04,Unknown,You're my best friend and my best man.
09x04,Unknown,Of course I trust you.
09x04,Unknown,"Oh, come on."
09x04,Unknown,You don't have to cry about it.
09x04,Unknown,(sobs)
09x04,Unknown,It's not that.
09x04,Unknown,That was a $600 bottle of scotch.
09x04,(crying),"Oh, my God."
09x04,Unknown,(both blubbering)
09x04,Unknown,I hope Marshall gets here for the rehearsal dinner.
09x04,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x04,Unknown,He's somewhere in Wisconsin in a rental car.
09x04,Unknown,"Hertz? I mean, it hurts a little but I'm not gonna cry about it. Hey!"
09x04,Unknown,We've been doing that all afternoon.
09x04,ROBIN,"Oh, who's that for?"
09x04,Unknown,Marshpillow.
09x04,Unknown,"Kids, as you may recall, whenever Marshall left town for a few days, Lily would compensate with a body pillow she dressed up and named Marshpillow."
09x04,Unknown,Pretty normal stuff.
09x04,Unknown,"But with Marshall stuck driving across the country, Lily decided to upgrade."
09x04,Unknown,Meet Marshpillow 2.0!
09x04,Unknown,Hey!
09x04,Unknown,Am I on?
09x04,Unknown,"Hey, guys!"
09x04,Unknown,"Hey, Marsh. Hey, Marshall. Hey."
09x04,Unknown,It's like you're really here.
09x04,MARSHALL,"Hey, Ted."
09x04,Unknown,Can you give me a gander of the environs?
09x04,Unknown,Wow!
09x04,Unknown,This place looks beautif...
09x04,Unknown,Wait for it.
09x04,Unknown,He's frozen.
09x04,Unknown,(Lily groans)
09x04,Unknown,Same thing happened last night at the worst possible time.
09x04,Unknown,I had just gotten on all fours and taken off my panti...
09x04,Unknown,Now Lily's frozen.
09x04,Unknown,♪ How I Met Your Mother 9x04 ♪
09x04,Unknown,The Broken Code
09x04,Unknown,"Original Air Date on October 7, 2013"
09x04,Unknown,...ful.
09x04,Unknown,This place is beautiful!
09x04,Unknown,"Wow. Lily, it looks like you really put some time into this, huh?"
09x04,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x04,Unknown,"Though I wonder if instead of dressing up your giant husband doll like Malibu Ken, you could've spent a minute or two--"
09x04,Unknown,I don't know... planning the weak ass bachelorette party you threw me?
09x04,Unknown,I-It's possible I forgot to send out the Evite.
09x04,Unknown,Robin!
09x04,Unknown,Happy bachelorette party!
09x04,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x04,Unknown,You invited Patrice to my bachelorette party?!
09x04,Unknown,No.
09x04,Unknown,"You know, it's funny."
09x04,Unknown,"When I was planning Barney's bachelor party,"
09x04,Unknown,"I managed to wrangle his boyhood hero, Billy Zabka, from"
09x04,Unknown,The Karate Kid.
09x04,Unknown,But you scored Patrice.
09x04,Unknown,"I'm sorry, Robin."
09x04,Unknown,I-I've just been so consumed with our move to Rome.
09x04,Unknown,I guess I forgot to invite the girls.
09x04,Unknown,"Yeah, Lily, I'd like to show you how it's done."
09x04,Unknown,"Billy Zabka, what a great guy."
09x04,Unknown,Look at how thorough Ted was planning the best man poker game he's throwing for Barney.
09x04,Unknown,"Wait, I think I'm on some sort of delay here."
09x04,Unknown,(clears throat) Best man visor for the dealer.
09x04,Unknown,Customized playing cards.
09x04,Unknown,Barney's the king.
09x04,Unknown,And... the queens are naked.
09x04,Unknown,It was my first decree.
09x04,Unknown,"Hmm. Plus, Ted handwrote all of the table cards for the reception in calligraphy."
09x04,Unknown,The man's a wizard with a pen.
09x04,Unknown,Oh. I don't know about all that.
09x04,Unknown,Though I was approached by the decorating committee to make the... signs for our senior prom.
09x04,Unknown,I'm told they were quite the hit.
09x04,Unknown,(sucks air through teeth)
09x04,Unknown,"Hey, buddy, listen, you're gonna k*ll me, but I forgot to bring the table cards."
09x04,Unknown,"Uh, I'd hate to ask you to redo them..."
09x04,Unknown,Say no more. The best man is on it.
09x04,Unknown,"Thanks, Ted."
09x04,Unknown,(scoffs)
09x04,Unknown,S-So now the best man is painstakingly handwriting
09x04,Unknown,"200 table cards, but my maid of honor forgot to click ""send"" on an Evite."
09x04,Unknown,I didn't forget to invite the girls to your bachelorette party.
09x04,Unknown,You have no girls!
09x04,(high-pitched),What?
09x04,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x04,Unknown,What?
09x04,Unknown,What?
09x04,Unknown,What? I... All my girls.
09x04,Unknown,I gave you a list.
09x04,Unknown,This list?
09x04,Unknown,Yeah.
09x04,Unknown,"""Tall girl from work, ""mouth-breather from coffee shop, ""average-sized girl from that place""?"
09x04,Unknown,Ooh. Sorry I didn't track her down.
09x04,Unknown,She sounds great!
09x04,Unknown,She's actually kind of a b*tch.
09x04,Unknown,"Face it, Robin."
09x04,Unknown,"You hate women, and... women hate you."
09x04,Unknown,Ted didn't go to his prom?
09x04,Unknown,Classic.
09x04,Unknown,"While Lily was dropping the ball as Robin's maid of honor, the best man was busy knocking it out of the park."
09x04,Unknown,(sucks air through teeth)
09x04,Unknown,"Hey, buddy, listen, my great-aunt Ida has corns on her feet and needs a first-floor room."
09x04,Unknown,"Uh, would you mind switching rooms?"
09x04,Unknown,Say no more. The best man is on it.
09x04,Unknown,"Thanks, Ted."
09x04,Unknown,(shouts)
09x04,Unknown,(whoops) (sucks air through teeth)
09x04,Unknown,"Hey, buddy, listen, the wedding doves got here early, and I don't know where to put 'em..."
09x04,Unknown,Say no more. The best man is on it!
09x04,Unknown,"Thanks, Ted."
09x04,Unknown,(cooing)
09x04,Unknown,Poor guys.
09x04,Unknown,All cooped up.
09x04,Unknown,"I guess there's no harm in letting you out for a bit, huh?"
09x04,Unknown,They carpet-bombed my entire room.
09x04,Unknown,Wish I'd closed my suitcase.
09x04,Unknown,And my mouth.
09x04,Unknown,(sucks air through teeth)
09x04,Unknown,"Hey, buddy, listen, I see you wrote ""N-O-period"" instead of the number sign."
09x04,Unknown,I'm worried that might confuse the guests...
09x04,Unknown,Say no more.
09x04,Unknown,The best man is on it.
09x04,Unknown,"Thanks, Ted."
09x04,Unknown,(knocking)
09x04,Unknown,Here they are.
09x04,Unknown,Freshly penned table cards in a pretty decent chancery considering I only had my travel quills.
09x04,Unknown,Wait. Why's the poker game started?
09x04,Unknown,"Oh, um, the best man moved the time."
09x04,Unknown,"Mm, no, he didn't."
09x04,Unknown,"Yes, he did."
09x04,Unknown,"Heya, Ted."
09x04,Unknown,"Thanks for the sweet lid, bro."
09x04,(quietly),Billy Zabka's your new best man?
09x04,Unknown,He's the best... around.
09x04,Unknown,"Sorry, Ted. Maybe next wedding."
09x04,Unknown,What...
09x04,Unknown,So you're playing the best man poker game without me?
09x04,Unknown,Tim Gunn's here and I'm not?
09x04,Unknown,"I'm Barney's personal tailor, of course I'm here."
09x04,Unknown,"Plus, I've never played poker before."
09x04,Unknown,It looks like a hoot.
09x04,Unknown,I moved into a dungeon.
09x04,Unknown,I wrote hundreds of cards.
09x04,Unknown,I even gave your batty great-aunt Ida a foot massage so vigorous it put her to sleep right there in the lobby.
09x04,Unknown,"Yeah, I don't really have a great-aunt Ida."
09x04,Unknown,So you are mad about me and Robin holding hands.
09x04,Unknown,"Of course I'm mad, Ted."
09x04,Unknown,"Holding hands is, like, the fourth-grade equivalent of banging."
09x04,Unknown,"Well, in your case, 12th grade."
09x04,Unknown,Self-five.
09x04,Unknown,You broke the Bro Code.
09x04,Unknown,"No, I did not. I only went to help Robin as a friend because you didn't show up."
09x04,Unknown,I did not break the Bro Code.
09x04,Unknown,It's in the text.
09x04,Unknown,"A bro shall not have a weird moment with another bro's fiancée. Well, too bad we're in Farhampton and can't actually check."
09x04,Unknown,I am pleased to announce that the Bro Code has replaced the Gideons Bible at select hotels throughout the country.
09x04,Unknown,Oh.
09x04,Unknown,I'm sorry I said you hate women.
09x04,Unknown,"Yeah, don't be."
09x04,Unknown,"For whatever reason, I just..."
09x04,Unknown,(sighs) I can't seem to connect with them. Down!
09x04,Unknown,Can you help me? I've got a bunch more wedding gifts in the van.
09x04,Unknown,Yay! I love Robin so much!
09x04,(quietly),"Oh, God, I'm gonna strangle that b*tch."
09x04,Unknown,"Robin, what is it with you and women?"
09x04,Unknown,(groans)
09x04,Unknown,They're so annoying.
09x04,Unknown,I'm glad that you're my only female friend.
09x04,Unknown,Girls are always whining and crying over every little thing.
09x04,Unknown,(groans)
09x04,Unknown,(crying)
09x04,Unknown,Yes. That's exactly...
09x04,Unknown,"Thank you. ""Oh, oh, boo-hoo."
09x04,Unknown,"""Look at me. I'm a sensitive little girl..."" Oh. God, I'm sorry."
09x04,Unknown,You're actually crying.
09x04,Unknown,(groans)
09x04,Unknown,It's just so sad.
09x04,Unknown,(sobs)
09x04,Unknown,"I can't be your only girlfriend. Well, I..."
09x04,Unknown,I don't need anybody else. I got... I got you.
09x04,Unknown,For another six days and then I'm off to Rome for a year.
09x04,Unknown,(gasps) What are you gonna do without our Saturday morning brunch with a side of sassy gossip?
09x04,Unknown,A one-shot power play?!
09x04,Unknown,"Hey! Hey, Boston!"
09x04,Unknown,Why not drop your hockey pants and actually take a dump on the ice next time?!
09x04,Unknown,(cackles)
09x04,Unknown,I love it!
09x04,Unknown,(groans)
09x04,Unknown,See? It is just too horrible to even think about.
09x04,Unknown,Yeah. You... need another female friend.
09x04,Unknown,(sighs)
09x04,Unknown,"Whenever I try to talk to women, they look like they want to punch me."
09x04,Unknown,"Well, maybe you're accidentally giving off the wrong vibe."
09x04,Unknown,"Like, what do you say to other women at the gym?"
09x04,Unknown,"Oh, well, I haven't been to the gym in forever."
09x04,Unknown,My metabolism is all messed up.
09x04,Unknown,"See, I can moose down a pint of fudge ripple for a midnight snack and wake up having lost weight."
09x04,Unknown,(groans)
09x04,Unknown,"Well, everywhere except for my boobs."
09x04,Unknown,So annoying.
09x04,Unknown,You're gonna need a lot of work.
09x04,Unknown,It's in here. Somewhere.
09x04,Unknown,I... It has to be.
09x04,Unknown,"Damn it, I know I should've done these in alphabrotical order."
09x04,Unknown,(groans)
09x04,Unknown,Who cares about the Bro Code?
09x04,Unknown,It's just some stupid book you made up.
09x04,Unknown,(gasps)
09x04,Unknown,How dare you?
09x04,Unknown,The Bro Code has been around for centuries.
09x04,Unknown,Nay... whatever's more than centuries.
09x04,Unknown,Please don't launch into a fake history lesson.
09x04,Unknown,The Bro Code can trace its lineage all the way back to Broses himself.
09x04,Article one,bros before ho's.
09x04,Unknown,Okay.
09x04,Unknown,"I see what you're doing. You can't prove that I broke the Bro Code, so you're just making up stories about..."
09x04,Unknown,This sacred text was eventually brought to the New World in 1776 by none other than Christopher Brolumbus.
09x04,Article 62,a bro who calls dibs first has dibs.
09x04,Unknown,Oh? Dibs!
09x04,Unknown,And that's why he got to bang Pocahontas.
09x04,Unknown,Pocahontas was with John Smith.
09x04,Unknown,Maybe according to the hotel register.
09x04,Unknown,"Whatever Mrs. Brolumbus didn't know couldn't hurt her, am I right?"
09x04,Unknown,"Well, except maybe that New World syphilis."
09x04,Unknown,But I digress.
09x04,Unknown,"Barney, if you believe in the Bro Code, how come you've broken it so many times?"
09x04,Unknown,(gasps loudly)
09x04,Unknown,How dare you!
09x04,Unknown,I have
09x04,Unknown,never
09x04,Unknown,broken the Bro Code!
09x04,Unknown,Hmm? Hmm? Ah.
09x04,"""Article 104","the mom of a bro is always off limits."""
09x04,Unknown,"Okay, look, we've all had a lot of fun joking about me banging your mom."
09x04,Unknown,Not all of us. Continue.
09x04,Unknown,But I swear nothing ever happened between the two of us.
09x04,Unknown,Trust me.
09x04,Unknown,And what's going on with your fingers?
09x04,(whispering),That's how our bodies were intertwined.
09x04,Unknown,"All right, this is ridiculous!"
09x04,Unknown,It's ridiculous that you won't admit holding Robin's hand was weird.
09x04,Unknown,It wasn't weird!
09x04,Unknown,"Yes, it was."
09x04,Unknown,You know what?
09x04,Unknown,We need a third impartial bro to settle this.
09x04,Unknown,"To resolve this, I really need to parse the text of the Bro Code."
09x04,Unknown,It's too bad Marshall doesn't have a copy.
09x04,Unknown,"Actually, I do."
09x04,Unknown,"They were in the, uh, seat back pockets on my flight in place of the safety cards."
09x04,Unknown,I'm also pleased to announce
09x04,Unknown,The Bro Code
09x04,Unknown,is now available in select airlines across the country.
09x04,Unknown,And Lufthansa.
09x04,Unknown,Der Bro Code
09x04,Unknown,"is, like, huge in Germany."
09x04,Unknown,"Okay, so prove to me you can make a female friend."
09x04,Unknown,What about her?
09x04,Unknown,Ugh! The girl with the bangs?
09x04,Unknown,Any chick who does that to her hair is going through a big life transition I don't want to hear about.
09x04,Unknown,"Next time, grow your bangs long enough to cover your mouth."
09x04,Unknown,Ha-pass.
09x04,Unknown,"Okay, well... what about her?"
09x04,Unknown,Ugh! Comfortable shoes?
09x04,Unknown,(laughing)
09x04,Unknown,"What, are you filibustering later?"
09x04,It's after 5,00. Put on some heels.
09x04,Unknown,Ha-pass.
09x04,Unknown,"Okay, well, what about...? Ugh!"
09x04,Unknown,I haven't even pointed to anyone yet!
09x04,Unknown,"Now,"
09x04,Unknown,"although not expressly stated in the Bro Code, a weird moment between a bro and his bro's fiancée is, in my bropinion... a violation."
09x04,Unknown,"No! Yes! However, Ted was helping Robin as a friend."
09x04,Unknown,"Therefore, holding her hand isn't"
09x04,Unknown,necessarily
09x04,Unknown,a weird moment.
09x04,Unknown,No! Yes!
09x04,Unknown,That being said...
09x04,Unknown,What?
09x04,Unknown,(mutters)
09x04,Unknown,...if we decide that holding
09x04,Unknown,any
09x04,Unknown,"friend's hand is weird, then, yes, Ted did break the Bro Code."
09x04,Unknown,"So, the question is this."
09x04,Unknown,If Ted had gone to the park and held
09x04,Unknown,Barney's
09x04,Unknown,"hand, would it have been weird?"
09x04,Unknown,No? Yes?
09x04,Unknown,See?
09x04,Unknown,(scoffs)
09x04,Unknown,It's not weird at all.
09x04,Unknown,I don't know what to say.
09x04,Unknown,Just be yourself.
09x04,Unknown,Say something nice.
09x04,Unknown,Which one? I can't do both.
09x04,Unknown,sl*t alert.
09x04,Unknown,That's my 14-year-old daughter.
09x04,Unknown,Crappy mom alert.
09x04,Unknown,Ugh!
09x04,Unknown,It's you. Nice bangs.
09x04,Unknown,What is wrong with you?!
09x04,Unknown,"I can't do this, okay?"
09x04,Unknown,I was raised as a boy.
09x04,Unknown,I don't get along with women.
09x04,Unknown,Can we just drop it?
09x04,Unknown,"Okay, I never thought I'd take a page out of your fiancé's playbook, but... it's time to target the crying chick."
09x04,Unknown,Not weird at all.
09x04,BARNEY,"Marshall, why are we doing this?!"
09x04,Unknown,Two dudes on a beach with a lifeless blob they're pretending is alive?
09x04,Unknown,It's stupid.
09x04,Unknown,"So, I guess that means"
09x04,Unknown,Weekend at Bernie's
09x04,Unknown,"is stupid, too."
09x04,Unknown,(gasps)
09x04,Unknown,E-Lawyered.
09x04,Unknown,"Now, before I can render a decision, we need to recreate the variables at the carousel as closely as possible."
09x04,Unknown,"Since Ted says that he was comforting Robin, he needs to do the same for Barney, so, Ted, comfort Barney."
09x04,Unknown,I don't see how that...
09x04,Unknown,Comfort... Barney.
09x04,Unknown,(sputters)
09x04,Unknown,"Barney, what is going on with you?"
09x04,Unknown,Why are you so upset with me?
09x04,Unknown,"Marshall, this is stupid! I don't..."
09x04,Unknown,Accept the comfort.
09x04,Unknown,Fine!
09x04,Unknown,(sighs)
09x04,Unknown,I guess... I'm not really mad at you.
09x04,Unknown,"I'm mad at myself. I should have met Robin at the carousel when she called, but I was having such a good time greasing 12-year-olds."
09x04,Unknown,Laser tag.
09x04,Unknown,Helpful. Continue.
09x04,Unknown,"Look, Ted, I'm sorry that I've been taking it out on you."
09x04,Unknown,You were just being a good friend to Robin.
09x04,Unknown,It's okay.
09x04,Unknown,"It would be different if you still had feelings for her, but you don't, right?"
09x04,Unknown,Right?
09x04,Unknown,(thunder booming)
09x04,Unknown,"Okay, now it's weird."
09x04,Unknown,You still have feelings for Robin?!
09x04,Unknown,What?! What?! What?! What?!
09x04,Unknown,"Okay, yes, sometimes I do."
09x04,Unknown,"Well, then, turn 'em off!"
09x04,Unknown,"I would love to, but it doesn't work that way!"
09x04,Unknown,I'm a... I'm a human being. I-I-I don't have an off switch.
09x04,Unknown,I'm shutting off.
09x04,Unknown,"There, there."
09x04,Unknown,Sister?
09x04,Unknown,Who needs a lady hug?
09x04,Unknown,Ugh! What the hell are you doing?!
09x04,Unknown,"Wait. Did you jus,[/i] tugh"" my hug?"
09x04,Unknown,I don't need a hug.
09x04,Unknown,I'm pissed off because the Rangers just lost to the Boston Bruins.
09x04,BOTH,I hate the Boston Bruins!
09x04,Unknown,(laughs)
09x04,Unknown,"Look, Barney, I hate these feelings."
09x04,Unknown,I hate myself for having these feelings.
09x04,Unknown,"No one wishes they would go away more than I do, but I just... I... I can't seem to make that happen. I've tried."
09x04,Unknown,"Well, then, try harder!"
09x04,Unknown,I'm marrying her in less than two days!
09x04,Unknown,What the hell are we gonna do about this?!
09x04,Unknown,"As she watched Robin make a new friend, Lily was happy... for two seconds."
09x04,Unknown,"Oh, no! Oh, come on, ref!"
09x04,Unknown,I haven't seen that much hooking go unpunished since my last trip to Vegas.
09x04,Unknown,"And I was on that trip, because we are best friends now."
09x04,Unknown,(laughs)
09x04,Unknown,(both laughing)
09x04,Unknown,"Hey, this might sound a little nutty, but how about we inject a sexual edge into our abiding friendship that..."
09x04,BOTH,"...in no way jeopardizes our emotional connection, or respective marriages?!"
09x04,Unknown,(both giggling)
09x04,Unknown,Aw!
09x04,Unknown,"Hell,"
09x04,Unknown,no!
09x04,Unknown,Excuse me.
09x04,Unknown,"I've got a Boston Brewin', if you know what I mean."
09x04,Unknown,(laughs)
09x04,Unknown,"You listen, and you listen good."
09x04,Unknown,"If I see your face around Robin again, you will be crying about a lot more than your precious New York Rogers."
09x04,Unknown,Rangers? I will cut you!
09x04,Unknown,(Lily mutters gibberish)
09x04,Unknown,Forgot my purse.
09x04,Unknown,(mutters)
09x04,Unknown,You know what?
09x04,Unknown,That's why I only need you.
09x04,Unknown,'Cause you're a psycho.
09x04,Unknown,My psycho.
09x04,Unknown,"I am, aren't I? Mm-hmm."
09x04,Unknown,(giggling)
09x04,Unknown,There's the blushing bride!
09x04,Unknown,"Back off, Patrice!"
09x04,Unknown,"Look, Barney, the truth is, it was weird at the carousel."
09x04,Unknown,"On some level, it's probably been weird between me and Robin ever since we broke up."
09x04,Unknown,But you're my brother.
09x04,Unknown,"I would never do anything to hurt you, ever."
09x04,Unknown,(scoffs)
09x04,Unknown,"I mean it, I swear!"
09x04,Unknown,I'll-I'll even swear it on the Bro Code.
09x04,Unknown,The Bro Code's stupid.
09x04,Unknown,(gasps)
09x04,Unknown,How dare you!
09x04,Unknown,I'd be honored.
09x04,Unknown,I can't promise that I'll ever get to a place where it won't be at least a little weird between me and Robin.
09x04,Unknown,"But I don't want to lose you as a friend, either of you."
09x04,Unknown,So I will do everything I can to move on and live with it.
09x04,Unknown,The question is... can you?
09x04,Unknown,(sighs)
09x04,Unknown,"I'm sorry, Ted. I just... can't do this."
09x04,Unknown,I fold.
09x04,Unknown,What about the best man?
09x04,Unknown,"I fold, too."
09x04,Unknown,I fold.
09x04,Unknown,There goes my belly buster.
09x04,Unknown,"You sandbag all night, only to bluff a couple of rags, pre-flop, and wind up with a dry board."
09x04,Unknown,That's what you get for limping in shorts-tacked with a pack of donkeys.
09x04,Unknown,Muck city.
09x04,Unknown,I fold!
09x04,Unknown,"Yeah... Oh, right. I knew that."
09x04,Unknown,"I knew that, I knew that, I knew that."
09x04,Unknown,"Okay, two players left."
09x04,Unknown,"You are bluffing, robot man."
09x04,Unknown,I raise.
09x04,BARNEY,Oh.
09x04,Unknown,"Hey, Billy, do you mind pushing my chips into the center of the pot?"
09x04,Unknown,"Preferably with gusto, because..."
09x04,Unknown,I'm all in!
09x04,Unknown,"Oh! Oh, boy!"
09x04,"All right, all right. ALL",Oh!
09x04,Unknown,(cheering and laughing)
09x04,Unknown,And that's how I became Barney's best man again.
09x04,Unknown,Everything was back to going off without a hitch.
09x04,Unknown,"I'm coming for you, Mosby."
09x04,Unknown,"Okay, there was one slight hitch."
09x05,Unknown,"Ooh, Chicago!"
09x05,Unknown,There is this pizza place called Gazzola's.
09x05,Unknown,It's fantastic.
09x05,Unknown,"It was closed down for a while, but it just reopened."
09x05,Unknown,I'm sure they got a Godzilla's in New York.
09x05,Unknown,We're not stopping.
09x05,Unknown,It's just pizza.
09x05,Unknown,Just... pizza?
09x05,Unknown,Let me tell you about the thing you say is just pizza.
09x05,Unknown,We begin with the first bite.
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, the crunch!"
09x05,Unknown,And then the marinara.
09x05,Unknown,That roiling lava of tomato and oregano... it overtakes you!
09x05,Unknown,I'm falling!
09x05,Unknown,And that's.... when she catches you.
09x05,Unknown,"That chewy, voluptuous mistress, Mozzarella."
09x05,Unknown,"Her oven-kissed cheeks crackle with warmth in your mouth, cradling the sauce and the bread, letting you know that from now on... this... is home."
09x05,Unknown,This pizza... is home.
09x05,Unknown,"If it was so delicious, why'd they close it in the first place?"
09x05,Unknown,Rats. We're not stopping!
09x05,Unknown,This road trip sucks!

09x05,Unknown,Barney's bachelor poker game was winding down.
09x05,Unknown,"Tim Gunn, out."
09x05,Unknown,"Lily, busted."
09x05,Unknown,"Marshpillow, fluffed and turned down."
09x05,Unknown,"We were playing what we thought was our final hand, and it was getting intense."
09x05,Unknown,Action to Ranjit.
09x05,Unknown,"Ranjit, action to you."
09x05,Unknown,What?!
09x05,Unknown,"Hey, Ted, thanks again for your gift."
09x05,Unknown,"He gave us a framed photo of all of us at the bar, and he's getting us two other wedding gifts."
09x05,Unknown,What can I say? I just love giving wedding gifts.
09x05,Unknown,"I love giving wedding gifts so much, I wish I could marry giving-wedding-gifts, and then get myself and giving-wedding-gifts a wedding gift."
09x05,Unknown,Maybe saying things like that's why I am not married.
09x05,Unknown,(laughter)
09x05,Unknown,"Kids, there's a story behind that face."
09x05,Unknown,"Six years earlier, a few weeks after their wedding, Marshall and Lily were going through their wedding gifts."
09x05,Unknown,"Well, that's weird."
09x05,Unknown,Did Ted get us anything?
09x05,Unknown,"Come on, Lily."
09x05,Unknown,Ted... Ted's our best friend.
09x05,Unknown,"If his gift hasn't arrived yet, it's on the way."
09x05,Unknown,"But time passed, and no gift arrived."
09x05,Unknown,"Finally, Marshall started dropping hints."
09x05,Unknown,"Hey, man, it was great having you at our wedding."
09x05,Unknown,"Thanks, Bro, and thanks for this coffee."
09x05,Unknown,It is great.
09x05,Unknown,You were not wedding absent.
09x05,Unknown,"No, sir."
09x05,Unknown,You were wedding
09x05,Unknown,present.
09x05,Unknown,Do I detect a note of hazelnut?
09x05,Unknown,(laughs)
09x05,Unknown,Wedding present.
09x05,Unknown,I think he got it.
09x05,Unknown,But I didn't get it.
09x05,Unknown,More months passed.
09x05,Unknown,His hints got more desperate.
09x05,Unknown,Happy Halloween!
09x05,Unknown,Yeah. What-what are you supposed to be?
09x05,Unknown,"Well, I'm a wedding present, Ted!"
09x05,Unknown,How could you not get me a wedding present?
09x05,Unknown,"I mean, how could you not get that I am a wedding present?"
09x05,Unknown,Get me? A wedding present!
09x05,Unknown,Get me a wedding present.
09x05,Unknown,Why isn't he getting it?!
09x05,Unknown,I don't know.
09x05,Unknown,"Why didn't you get the message to dress up like a pregnant teenager, home skillet?"
09x05,Unknown,But he kept on waiting until the summer of 2008 when I got engaged.
09x05,Unknown,"So Ted's getting married, huh?"
09x05,Unknown,Bet he'd love a gift from his old pal Marshall.
09x05,Unknown,"Well, he can forget it!"
09x05,Unknown,We're getting them a gift.
09x05,Unknown,"But Lily, this is the dream."
09x05,Unknown,This is the whole reason we wanted Ted to
09x05,Unknown,get
09x05,Unknown,married.
09x05,Unknown,"So we could not give him a wedding gift, and he would know exactly how it feels!"
09x05,Unknown,"Baby, I'm as pissed as you are, but we're getting them a gift."
09x05,Unknown,We have to.
09x05,Unknown,Fine.
09x05,Unknown,We'll get them a gift.
09x05,Unknown,A gift that'll send a message loud and clear.
09x05,Unknown,A gift-wrapping station! (laughs)

09x05,Unknown,has

09x05,Unknown,"It's a little late, but..."
09x05,Unknown,What the balls is this?!
09x05,Unknown,It-It's a thank you note for the gift-wrapping station.
09x05,Unknown,Which explains the face.
09x05,Unknown,Wedding gift.
09x05,JAMES,"Hey, Barney."
09x05,Unknown,"I've got a wedding gift for you, too."
09x05,Unknown,Don't get married. (laughs)
09x05,Unknown,Ah.
09x05,Unknown,"In fact, it comes in His and Hers."
09x05,(in deep voice),Don't get married!
09x05,(in high-pitched voice),Don't get married!

09x05,Unknown,I'm not cheating! Don't tell anyone!
09x05,Unknown,I'll cut you in on half!
09x05,Unknown,"Hey, Barney, can you ask James to stop crapping all over marriage?"
09x05,Unknown,He's not crapping on marriage.
09x05,Unknown,He literally drew this on the toilet.
09x05,Unknown,"Come on, Robin. Please don't ask me to pick sides."
09x05,Unknown,"In two days, he's gonna be your brother, too."
09x05,Unknown,Just be honest and tell him what's bothering you.
09x05,Unknown,Okay.

09x05,Unknown,I should take this.
09x05,Unknown,"Well, call me Akira Yoshizawa."
09x05,Unknown,World's most famous origamist?
09x05,Unknown,I fold.
09x05,Unknown,(overlapping chatter)
09x05,Unknown,"Barney, here's a good one."
09x05,Unknown,What's the difference between a Journey song and a husband?
09x05,Unknown,A Journey song has a climax.
09x05,Unknown,(laughs)
09x05,Unknown,(laughs)
09x05,Unknown,"I'm sorry, Robin."
09x05,Unknown,I'm just messing with you.
09x05,Unknown,Raise a hundred.
09x05,Unknown,"No, it's fine."
09x05,Unknown,It's just funny hearing all this anti-marriage stuff from a divorced guy who still wears his wedding ring.
09x05,Unknown,"What, this? Mm."
09x05,Unknown,"Only wear it because, nothing attracts a gay guy faster than a wedding ring."
09x05,Unknown,Except saying hi to him.
09x05,Unknown,"Or being in the same room, or every app on my phone."
09x05,Unknown,"People, it is a good time to be gay."
09x05,Unknown,So you can just... you can take that ring off anytime you want?
09x05,Unknown,Anytime.
09x05,Unknown,I'm all in.
09x05,Unknown,And raise you... one ring.
09x05,ALL,Ooh!
09x05,Unknown,Fine.
09x05,Unknown,It's just a ring.
09x05,Unknown,"Okay, let's see what you got."
09x05,Unknown,"Robin has three jacks, James has... just shy of a pair of a sixes."
09x05,Unknown,Thank you.
09x05,Unknown,Yeah.
09x05,Unknown,I'm gonna hit the gym.
09x05,Unknown,Let me know if you want to get some dinner later.
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, we'll give you a ring, just not this one. Ho!"
09x05,Unknown,(laughs)
09x05,MARSHALL,"You, Ted Mosby, never got me and Lily a wedding gift!"
09x05,Unknown,J'accuse!
09x05,Unknown,"I did, too, get you a gift!"
09x05,Unknown,"It was a coffeemaker, and you never sent me a thank you note!"
09x05,Unknown,Oh.
09x05,Unknown,So-so...
09x05,Unknown,me-cuse?
09x05,Unknown,You-cuse!
09x05,Unknown,"Robin, when I said, ""Be honest and say what's bothering you,"""
09x05,Unknown,"I meant, stuff it down and never do anything about it."
09x05,Unknown,How did you not get that?
09x05,Unknown,It's fine. He's a grown-up.
09x05,Unknown,(door opens)
09x05,Unknown,What did you do to my little boy?
09x05,Unknown,(thunder crackling)
09x05,Unknown,"Hi, Mom."
09x05,Unknown,"You get your brother's ring back! Mom, please don't make me take sides! That's your brother out there."
09x05,Unknown,"You two shared bunk beds and baseball mitts, and, when you were hungry, these supple breasts."
09x05,Unknown,Arguably a little too long.
09x05,Unknown,Stinsons stand up for each other.
09x05,Unknown,Take care of this!
09x05,Unknown,I... I'm gonna play some cards.
09x05,Unknown,"All right, chumps."
09x05,I'm gonna tell you what I told Frampton's guitar tech when he couldn't find a condom,let's gamble.
09x05,Unknown,You gave us a coffeemaker?
09x05,Unknown,Not just
09x05,Unknown,ah
09x05,Unknown,coffeemaker.
09x05,Unknown,I asked what they used at your favorite coffeehouse and got you that exact... one tier down model.
09x05,Unknown,And you know what you got me? Huh?
09x05,Unknown,No thank you note.
09x05,Unknown,So I started dropping hints about it.
09x05,Unknown,Do I detect a note of hazelnut?
09x05,Unknown,Wedding present.
09x05,Unknown,Kind of want to say thank you to that note of hazelnut.
09x05,Unknown,Thank you... note.
09x05,Unknown,(laughs)
09x05,Unknown,Wedding... present.
09x05,Unknown,Anyway...
09x05,Unknown,Thank you note.
09x05,Unknown,"Yeah, he got it."
09x05,Unknown,But you never got it!
09x05,Unknown,"I drank so much coffee that year, hoping you'd take the hint, my resting pulse was like the drum solo from ""Wipeout."""
09x05,Unknown,"And then, uh, Halloween rolled around."
09x05,Unknown,Get me a wedding present.
09x05,Unknown,On that note...
09x05,Unknown,I think you'll like my costume.
09x05,Unknown,Mm.
09x05,Unknown,I'm a thank you note.
09x05,Unknown,Thank you note. Ah.
09x05,Unknown,Guess you could say that we sort of go together.
09x05,Unknown,"That's right, Marshall. That's right."
09x05,Unknown,"When someone gets you a gift, you give them a thank you note."
09x05,Unknown,That is how it works.
09x05,Unknown,"Give a gift, get a note."
09x05,Unknown,Agreed. Exactly.
09x05,Unknown,Exactly.
09x05,Unknown,Exactly. Exactly.
09x05,Unknown,I think he got it.
09x05,Unknown,"Yeah. Yeah, he got it."
09x05,Unknown,I have to find a bathroom.
09x05,Unknown,I didn't get it!
09x05,Unknown,And I thought for sure you'd get it when I sent that thank you note for the wrapping station.
09x05,Unknown,"""Dear Marshall and Lily, ""this is a thank you note to thank yo,"
09x05,Unknown,ufor the gift-wrapping station.
09x05,Unknown,"""Because even though the wedding never happened, ""there's one thing that didn't leave me at the altar, and that's my manners.""[/i]"
09x05,Unknown,I can't believe this.
09x05,Unknown,Eriksens send thank you notes.
09x05,Unknown,It's the one thing that we always do!
09x05,Unknown,We even have a family saying about it.
09x05,Unknown,"""Lick it, before you stick it!"""
09x05,Unknown,"""It"" being the stamp on the thank you note, before you stick it in the mailbox."
09x05,Unknown,I will make this right!
09x05,Unknown,"I know, right?"
09x05,Unknown,"Hey, listen, we're about to go through a tunnel."
09x05,Unknown,"Guys, big dilemma."
09x05,Unknown,"My mom's insisting that I get Robin to give James his ring back, but Robin's refusing."
09x05,Unknown,But James seems like he's really upset.
09x05,Unknown,But Robin's gonna be my wife.
09x05,Unknown,But James is my brother.
09x05,Unknown,But Robin lets me do sex to her.
09x05,Unknown,But I have to spend eternity in my mom's mausoleum.
09x05,Unknown,I just wish there was a way I didn't have to take sides!
09x05,Unknown,What should I do?!
09x05,Unknown,(exhales)
09x05,Unknown,Choose your wife.
09x05,Unknown,You always choose your wife. Easy.
09x05,Unknown,"Got any other stumpers, like how to answe,[/i] rDoes this make me look fat?"""
09x05,Unknown,"Well, maybe a little around the hips but no more than usual."
09x05,Unknown,"You're getting married, so I will deal with that one after your honeymoon."
09x05,Unknown,And she did.
09x05,Unknown,Belize was amazi...
09x05,Unknown,(groaning)
09x05,Unknown,"In marriage, being right is less important than being supportive."
09x05,Remember,happy wife equals happy life.
09x05,Unknown,"Wow, thanks. That's some great advice, Lil."
09x05,Unknown,I knew I could count on you.
09x05,Unknown,He's gotten very respectful with his fake listening.
09x05,Unknown,"Anyway, Lily, I told Marshall this already, but... don't worry about not sending a thank you note for the coffeemaker. It's cool."
09x05,Unknown,"Uh, we did send a thank you note for the coffeemaker."
09x05,Unknown,"Uh... no, you didn't."
09x05,Unknown,"Uh... yes, we did."
09x05,Unknown,"To Stuart and Claudia, the people who gave us the coffeemaker."
09x05,Unknown,Uh... what?
09x05,Unknown,"Hey, you two!"
09x05,Unknown,Hey. Hey.
09x05,Unknown,"Hey, thanks again for that coffeemaker."
09x05,Unknown,We use it all the time.
09x05,Unknown,Especially when Ted's over.
09x05,Unknown,"Yeah, it's a great machine."
09x05,Unknown,We have one at home and we love it.
09x05,Unknown,Did I forget to get you a wedding gift?
09x05,Unknown,What kind of monster am I?
09x05,Unknown,Mosbys always give wedding gifts.
09x05,We even have an expression,"""Wrap it before you tap it."""
09x05,Unknown,"You know, wrap the gift before you tap the person on the shoulder and say, ""Here's your gift."""
09x05,Unknown,I will make this right.
09x05,Robin? Two things,"number one, are you dropping heat right now?"
09x05,Unknown,No. Great.
09x05,Unknown,Number two.
09x05,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x05,Unknown,"Nice. Thanks. Anyway, I came up with an amazing plan that I think will make everyone happy."
09x05,Step one,you let my mom win the ring back in a hand of poker.
09x05,Unknown,Step two...
09x05,Unknown,"No, that's all the steps."
09x05,Unknown,What do you think?
09x05,Unknown,So your plan is you do absolutely nothing to get your fiancée's back.
09x05,Unknown,Okay.
09x05,Unknown,Let me propose a different plan.
09x05,Unknown,Step one...
09x05,Unknown,"Good game, everybody!"
09x05,Unknown,(giggles)
09x05,Unknown,And that's all the steps.
09x05,Unknown,"That's a really pretty bra, Mom."
09x05,Unknown,"Well, I'd better leave now before I lose any more of my dignity, the likelihood of which is increasing every moment in this very chilly room."
09x05,Unknown,Oh...
09x05,Unknown,(door shuts)
09x05,Unknown,"Not good, Robin."
09x05,Unknown,Very not good.
09x05,Unknown,"How do you keep winning, anyway?"
09x05,Unknown,"Well, to the keen observer, all of you Stinsons have the same"
09x05,Unknown,very
09x05,Unknown,subtle tell.
09x05,Unknown,"Whenever you're bluffing, you say the word ""bluff."""
09x05,Unknown,"Hey, I'm hungry. Uh... should we get some bluffalo wings?"
09x05,Unknown,Raise you $20.
09x05,Unknown,"When I walked in, I saw an all-you-can-eat bluffet."
09x05,Unknown,Raise $50.
09x05,Unknown,Mmm... I could use a bluffberry muffin.
09x05,Unknown,A blueberry bluffin. Sorry.
09x05,Unknown,A bluebluffy muffbluff. All in.
09x05,Unknown,I don't believe it.
09x05,Unknown,"Robin, you've got to give her that blouse back."
09x05,Unknown,She loves that blouse.
09x05,Unknown,She got those sequins from Rick James...'s open casket.
09x05,Unknown,Nope. Not happening.
09x05,Unknown,"Woman, as your bridegroom, I command you!"
09x05,Unknown,We'll leave and give you guys some privacy.
09x05,Unknown,(door shuts)
09x05,Unknown,"You, uh, want to take back that ""I command you"" thing?"
09x05,Unknown,Please can I?
09x05,Unknown,Why is this so important to you?
09x05,Unknown,Because it's my family.
09x05,Unknown,"And, so help me, you and I will never have sex again if you don't give back their bluff."
09x05,Unknown,Stuff! Damn it.
09x05,Unknown,"Look, I just... I want to feel like you're on my side once in a while. That's all."
09x05,Unknown,"Look, I'm gonna be your wife, for God's sakes."
09x05,Unknown,"But, look, if it's... if it's that important to you, here."
09x05,Unknown,Do what you want.
09x05,Unknown,Thank you.
09x05,Unknown,And please don't play strip poker with my mom again.
09x05,Unknown,It's all kinds of confusing.
09x05,Unknown,(door shuts)
09x05,Unknown,(sighs)
09x05,Unknown,(phone ringing)
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, that's where my phone is."
09x05,Unknown,"I wasn't eavesdropping. Hey, baby."
09x05,Unknown,"Lily, we were wrong the whole time."
09x05,Unknown,Ted got us the coffeemaker!
09x05,Unknown,He's a wonderful man!
09x05,Unknown,What? No. Claudia and Stuart gave us our coffeemaker.
09x05,Unknown,Ted's a rat bastard! Never mention his name again!
09x05,Unknown,Your coffeemaker?
09x05,Unknown,Ted got you that.
09x05,Unknown,I was with him when he bought it.
09x05,Unknown,I don't know what to feel!
09x05,Unknown,But Stuart said he got it for us.
09x05,Unknown,Stuart and Claudia checked in.
09x05,Unknown,I saw them in the lobby.
09x05,Unknown,Let's go get to the bottom of this.
09x05,Unknown,"Stuart, no B.S., did you really get us that coffeemaker for our wedding?"
09x05,Unknown,Of course.
09x05,Unknown,What a crazy thing to ask.
09x05,Unknown,They never give you enough of these things.
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
09x05,Unknown,"Ted got us that coffeemaker, and you just played it off as your gift."
09x05,Unknown,You're a weasel. Admit it.
09x05,Unknown,"No, that's insane."
09x05,Unknown,Really?
09x05,Unknown,Housekeeping!
09x05,Unknown,Conditioner thief!
09x05,Unknown,"Okay, shh, shh. Yes, I am a weasel."
09x05,Unknown,I ripped the card off Ted's gift and I wrote my name on it.
09x05,Unknown,Does Claudia know about this?
09x05,Unknown,No. Please don't tell her.
09x05,Unknown,That gift was a turning point for us.
09x05,Unknown,Ah.
09x05,Unknown,"I got to admit, I came pretty close to leaving you."
09x05,Unknown,"Bags packed, plane ticket purchased, topless pics sent to your brother, the whole nine."
09x05,Unknown,"But seeing that you got our friends such a nice gift, ah, it just really puts you in a whole new light."
09x05,Unknown,Oh.
09x05,Unknown,I'm a pretty great guy. Oh.
09x05,Unknown,(water running in background)
09x05,Unknown,"And since that day, on the foundation of that coffeemaker, we've built a strong, nurturing relationship."
09x05,Unknown,"Well, out of respect for your marriage, I won't say anything."
09x05,Unknown,Say hi to Claudia when she gets out of the shower.
09x05,Unknown,That's not Claudia. Good night.
09x05,Unknown,Tap tap.
09x05,Unknown,Look what I wrapped!
09x05,Unknown,What?
09x05,Unknown,(door opens)
09x05,Unknown,(sighs)
09x05,Unknown,"So, I went to give James his ring back..."
09x05,Unknown,Glad you came to your senses.
09x05,Unknown,You can't let being married keep you from being you.
09x05,Unknown,"It's like Tom, always telling me I spend too much time at the gym."
09x05,Unknown,Exactly. Is it so wrong if you want to work out a couple times a week?
09x05,Unknown,Right. Or a couple times a day.
09x05,Unknown,Or a couple times...
09x05,Unknown,A couple times a day? Really?
09x05,Unknown,"A few hours before work, a few hours after."
09x05,Unknown,Only way to keep up the chocolate xylophone.
09x05,Unknown,(singing notes)
09x05,Unknown,"Still, that's a lot of time at the gym."
09x05,Unknown,Especially with two kids.
09x05,Unknown,"It's like I always said to Tom, ""I've got to stay in shape in case I'm ever single again."""
09x05,Unknown,"And, hello, I was right."
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
09x05,Unknown,I think I finally understand what Lily was mumbling in my peripheral vision earlier.
09x05,Unknown,"I'm marrying Robin so I can be part of a team, not just some guy alone at a gym with admittedly amazing abs."
09x05,Unknown,"Thanks, Bro."
09x05,Unknown,"No. Thank you, Bro."
09x05,Unknown,You're not getting this ring.
09x05,Unknown,I'm always gonna have your back.
09x05,Unknown,No matter what.
09x05,Unknown,Thank you.
09x05,Unknown,"I love you. Mmm, I love you, too."
09x05,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x05,Unknown,(moaning)
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, oh! I almost didn't tell you the best part!"
09x05,Unknown,There's more!
09x05,Unknown,Really?
09x05,"James, let me spell this out for you","now that I've got Robin, we are not brothers anymore."
09x05,Unknown,What?!
09x05,Unknown,Uh-huh.
09x05,Unknown,"If you and Robin are both ever hanging from a cliff and I have one hand free, enjoy the fall."
09x05,Unknown,"Uh, buh-bye."
09x05,Unknown,"If you... Oh, Mom! Good!"
09x05,Unknown,"You should hear this, too."
09x05,Unknown,This mother-son thing... it's over.
09x05,Unknown,"It's been a nice few decades, but I've got a wife now, so you mean"
09x05,Unknown,nothing
09x05,Unknown,to me.
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, and me coming over for Thanksgiving and Christmas, that's done!"
09x05,Unknown,No more of that!
09x05,Unknown,And you know why?
09x05,Unknown,Because Robin said so!
09x05,Unknown,This came directly from her!
09x05,Unknown,"See ya, losers!"
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
09x05,Unknown,Yeah.
09x05,Unknown,Fiancé of the year?
09x05,Unknown,"(chuckles) I think I know what's next. Oh, God."
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, God. I can't leave this room for the rest of the weekend."
09x05,Unknown,"I'm sure we can find something to do, eh?"
09x05,Unknown,"Ted, I'm so sorry!"
09x05,Unknown,"No, I'm sorry."
09x05,Unknown,I shouldn't have spent the last six years passive-aggressively drinking gallons of coffee around you.
09x05,Unknown,And I shouldn't have taken that sewing class to learn how to make that wedding present costume.
09x05,Unknown,"I regret all of it. Me, too!"
09x05,Unknown,Except I actually don't regret that sewing class.
09x05,Unknown,I learned a fun and useful lifetime skill.
09x05,Unknown,"But, seriously, even without the coffeemaker, you've given us more than enough."
09x05,Unknown,"Well, there is one more gift on the way."
09x05,Unknown,"Whatever it is, send it back."
09x05,Unknown,(horn honks)
09x05,Unknown,It's a little late for that.
09x05,Unknown,Marshall Eriksen?!
09x05,Unknown,Yes?!
09x05,Unknown,I got your pizza!
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, Ted!"
09x05,Unknown,You are the best friend ever!
09x05,Unknown,"Don't say another word, Marshall."
09x05,Unknown,Save it for the thank you note.
09x05,Unknown,"You got it, buddy!"
09x05,Unknown,"And, kids, I got that thank you note four months later."
09x05,Unknown,Four months.
09x05,Unknown,"Uh, here's your blouse back."
09x05,Unknown,"Is there any way we could just, um... forget about all this?"
09x05,Unknown,"Oh, no, dear, you keep the blouse."
09x05,Unknown,Think of it as your consolation prize.
09x05,Unknown,Consolation prize?
09x05,Unknown,You won the battle.
09x05,Unknown,But I'll win the w*r.
09x05,Unknown,"Game on, b*tch."
09x06,Unknown,"Look at this,"
09x06,Unknown,your wedding weekend. I know.
09x06,Unknown,This close to finally having sex again.
09x06,Unknown,It's been forever.
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, you and Robin been abstaining?"
09x06,Unknown,"Talking about you, Ted."
09x06,Now here's the deal,every hookup at a weekend wedding is decided at Friday night drinks.
09x06,Unknown,"Get stuck with the wrong girl tonight, the only action you'll be getting all weekend is a self-five, and I don't mean the cool kind."
09x06,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x06,Unknown,Self-five! That's the cool kind.
09x06,Unknown,"Well, that's a big decision."
09x06,Unknown,The biggest.
09x06,Unknown,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
09x06,Unknown,Remember? They entered a chamber.
09x06,Unknown,Really? I'm the one working with the Nazis?
09x06,Unknown,"Ted, just... just... okay?"
09x06,Unknown,Yeah. They had to choose which cup was this special cup.
09x06,Unknown,"I forget what it was called, but it's like the Holy Grail of cups."
09x06,Unknown,"It was the Holy Grail. Of cups, exactly."
09x06,Unknown,"So the n*zi confederate chose, and..."
09x06,(quietly),Please don't make me do that...
09x06,Unknown,"Ted, Ted, the confederate n*zi chose, and...? - I..."
09x06,Unknown,"Okay, okay."
09x06,Unknown,Oh.
09x06,Unknown,And so now I'm gonna explode.
09x06,Unknown,(expl*si*n sounds)
09x06,Unknown,He chose... poorly.
09x06,Unknown,"Then Indy picked a cup, and..."
09x06,Unknown,You chose... wisely.
09x06,Unknown,(playing surf guitar)
09x06,Unknown,"So choose wisely, Ted."
09x06,Unknown,"To help you decide, I spent all day yesterday picking your top three prospects."
09x06,Unknown,And I helped.
09x06,Unknown,It was either that or writing our vows.
09x06,Unknown,Uch! Gag.
09x06,Unknown,"Sophia was Robin's college roommate, and she's apparently ""a bit of a screamer"" in the sack."

09x06,Unknown,Ooh.

09x06,Unknown,I recommend
09x06,Unknown,(whistles) Sophia.
09x06,Unknown,I strongly feel that you should strongly feel her.
09x06,Unknown,"I guess it's decided, then."
09x06,Unknown,"Ted, right? Yeah."
09x06,Unknown,I'm Cassie.
09x06,Unknown,Oh... something tells me that we are gonna have a lot of fun this weekend. (chuckles)
09x06,(quietly),Cassie. I pick Cassie.

09x06,Unknown,"Original Air Date on October 21, 2013"
09x06,Unknown,"Hey, there's our minister."
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, what a sweet-looking old..."
09x06,Unknown,Ah! He looks scary.
09x06,Unknown,"Looks can be deceiving, Lily."
09x06,Unknown,But not in this case.
09x06,Unknown,He's a mean old tool.
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, he can't be that bad."
09x06,Unknown,I'll get him to come around. Just...
09x06,Unknown,"Hi, Reverend, I'm Lily Aldrin, the maid of honor."
09x06,Unknown,Not too much honor.
09x06,Unknown,You're dressed like a whore.
09x06,Unknown,(mouthing)
09x06,Unknown,So what's going on? Why aren't you telling your wife you got an offer to be a judge?
09x06,Unknown,"Lily had her heart set on us moving to Rome, so I have to tell her in person."
09x06,Unknown,"That way, I know that I can convince her that we need to stay."
09x06,Unknown,"In the courtroom, they call me The Convincer."
09x06,Unknown,They really call you that?
09x06,Unknown,I convinced them to call me that.
09x06,Unknown,But you have to prepare for your court cases.
09x06,Unknown,Did you prepare for talking to Lily?
09x06,Unknown,"I don't need to prepare, okay?"
09x06,Unknown,I can craft a nice... thingy.
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, wow I'm totally... the twisty metal thingy?"
09x06,Unknown,You're screwed.
09x06,Unknown,I'm screwed!
09x06,Unknown,(both laughing)
09x06,Unknown,"I'm sorry, Ted, I don't know."
09x06,I'm just so tired of this routine,"we flirt, we have a few drinks, and then we end the night with meaningless sex."
09x06,Unknown,Oh... yeah.
09x06,Unknown,"Me, too."
09x06,Unknown,Do you want to start the night with meaningless sex and then flirt later?
09x06,Unknown,You are a visionary.
09x06,Unknown,(laughs)
09x06,Unknown,Come on.
09x06,Unknown,(phone rings)
09x06,Unknown,Oh! Oh! It's work.
09x06,Unknown,Should I get it or ignore it?
09x06,Unknown,"Or get it? Oh, or ignore it?"
09x06,Unknown,Um... Forget it?
09x06,Unknown,"You know? Go ahead, get it."
09x06,Unknown,Okay. (clears throat)
09x06,Unknown,Hello?
09x06,Unknown,You chose... poorly.
09x06,Unknown,I'm fired?
09x06,Unknown,But teaching there was my dream job!
09x06,Unknown,And you guys are my only friends.
09x06,Unknown,You all hate me?
09x06,Unknown,Can I at least say good-bye to all my kids?
09x06,Unknown,My kids all hate me?!
09x06,Unknown,(sobbing)
09x06,Unknown,Oh!
09x06,Unknown,Oh. It's okay.
09x06,Unknown,"So, what were we about to do?"
09x06,Unknown,"I think it wa,[/i] smeaningless"" something?"
09x06,Unknown,Meaningless socks? No.
09x06,Unknown,(sobbing)
09x06,Unknown,"No, it wasn't meaningless socks."
09x06,Unknown,"Hey, hi, hi, hi."
09x06,Unknown,"Um, so, a little problem."
09x06,Unknown,I was trying really hard not to offend your minister...
09x06,Unknown,So how did you and your husband meet?
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, it was our first week of college."
09x06,Unknown,"I needed help hooking up my stereo, so I walked down the hall, and I just knew I should knock on this one door."
09x06,Unknown,Marshall opened it.
09x06,Unknown,It was destiny.
09x06,Unknown,Hi. Hi.
09x06,Unknown,We've been together ever since.
09x06,Unknown,Excuse me!
09x06,Unknown,What did I do wrong?
09x06,Unknown,What did
09x06,Unknown,you
09x06,Unknown,do wrong?
09x06,Unknown,We really wanted him to marry us.
09x06,Unknown,"His church has cute coming out the wazoo, but when we met with him..."
09x06,Unknown,No pets in my church.
09x06,Unknown,No casual attire in my church.
09x06,Unknown,No gum. No sports logos...
09x06,Unknown,Reverend? More like Never-end.
09x06,Unknown,Prayer-five. No shouting. No cell phones.
09x06,Unknown,I'll warn you that I turn down most wedding requests.
09x06,Unknown,"Particularly from boozy, promiscuous Manhattanites who only want me to marry them because my church has ""cute coming out the wazoo."""
09x06,Unknown,That is the total opposite of us.
09x06,Unknown,People are like that?
09x06,Unknown,"Well, then, how did you two meet?"
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, um, um..."
09x06,Unknown,Um...
09x06,Unknown,"Uh, we've been... dating since college."
09x06,Unknown,We met the very first week.
09x06,Unknown,"I needed help hooking up my stereo, so I walked down the hall, and I just knew that I should knock on this one door."
09x06,Unknown,I opened the door.
09x06,Unknown,And it was destiny.
09x06,Unknown,Hi.
09x06,Unknown,Hi.
09x06,BOTH,We've been together ever since!
09x06,Unknown,You stole our story of how we met?!
09x06,Unknown,We had to! Your story is so sweet! Mm.
09x06,Unknown,You didn't even kiss till the third date.
09x06,Unknown,"By our third date, I'd hit more bases than Bob Hope on a USO tour. Topical."
09x06,Unknown,Now Reverend Lowell knows that we lied to him.
09x06,Unknown,What if he cancels our wedding?
09x06,Unknown,What? That's ridiculous.
09x06,Unknown,"Barney, Robin, I need to speak with you in private immediately."
09x06,Unknown,"And it's not just losing my job, my car just got stolen with all my stuff in it."
09x06,Unknown,And now I think I'm getting the flu!
09x06,Unknown,I'm sorry.
09x06,Unknown,"I've been talking for, like, a half an hour."
09x06,Unknown,It's fine.
09x06,Unknown,40 minutes. It's fine.
09x06,Unknown,"Still, I think I would be able to handle all of this"
09x06,(voice breaks),if my boyfriend Wesley hadn't just broken up with me!
09x06,Unknown,(sobs softly)
09x06,Unknown,(inhales deeply)
09x06,Unknown,Why don't you tell me about it?
09x06,Unknown,Okay! I should go back to the beginning.
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, no, before the beginning."
09x06,Unknown,"Winter, 1998..."
09x06,Unknown,"Man, this girl is a drag!"
09x06,Unknown,"If I hurry, I bet I still have"
09x06,Unknown,a shot with Sophia.
09x06,Unknown,"Okay, I'll get one more drink with Cassie, then bail."
09x06,Unknown,"But where, bar or dining room?"
09x06,Unknown,Bar or dining room?
09x06,Unknown,"For my fourth date with Wesley, we went..."
09x06,Unknown,"Cassie, let's get one more drink in the dining room."
09x06,Unknown,You chose...
09x06,Unknown,"Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!"
09x06,Unknown,Hey! We just ordered appetizers.
09x06,Unknown,"Sit down, you two!"
09x06,Unknown,...Ha-poorly!
09x06,Unknown,"Marshall, you're walking into the biggest fight of your life."
09x06,Unknown,You have to be prepared. You have to be tough.
09x06,Unknown,"I am tough! No, you're not."
09x06,Unknown,You make some good points.
09x06,Unknown,"Now, what exactly are you gonna say to Lily when you walk through that door?"
09x06,Unknown,Okay.
09x06,Unknown,"Hey, baby."
09x06,Unknown,"So, listen, I got this phone call..."
09x06,Unknown,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
09x06,Unknown,You haven't seen her in a week.
09x06,Unknown,"Where's the ""I missed you""? How about a kiss?"
09x06,Unknown,Nothing about her new hairstyle?
09x06,Unknown,Hairstyle? I can't actually see...
09x06,Unknown,Start over!
09x06,Unknown,Lily! Hi.
09x06,Unknown,Mmm.
09x06,Unknown,I missed you.
09x06,Unknown,And your hairstyle so much.
09x06,DAPHNE'S VOICE,"I missed you, too."
09x06,Unknown,I can't wait to show you how much in bed tonight.
09x06,Unknown,"Okay, that's creepy."
09x06,Unknown,Don't break character.
09x06,Unknown,"Okay, um..."
09x06,Unknown,"So, listen, I got this phone call last week, and I..."
09x06,Unknown,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
09x06,Unknown,Acknowledge her own views on the matter first.
09x06,Unknown,Start over.
09x06,Unknown,"Lily, hi, mwah."
09x06,Unknown,I missed you and your hairstyle so much.
09x06,DAPHNE'S VOICE,"I missed you, too."
09x06,Unknown,"Okay, so, I know that you're excited for Rome."
09x06,Unknown,I'm more excited for bed tonight.
09x06,Unknown,"While I was away, uh, I got a phone call."
09x06,Unknown,To be a judge.
09x06,Unknown,What the damn hell?!
09x06,Unknown,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
09x06,Unknown,"Lily does not sa,[/i] yWhat the damn hell."""
09x06,Unknown,"Well, I've never met her but, yes, she does."
09x06,Unknown,You make some good points. Wow.
09x06,Unknown,You are terrible at this.
09x06,Unknown,(sighs)
09x06,Unknown,Why did we lie?
09x06,Unknown,We have to come clean.
09x06,Unknown,"Frankly, I am appalled."
09x06,Unknown,I know. I... Your friend Lily just tried to pass off your sweet story of how you met as her own.
09x06,Unknown,That lying little tart! I am horrified and relieved!
09x06,Unknown,Does Lily have any... problems that you're aware of?
09x06,Unknown,Drinking. dr*gs.
09x06,BOTH,She's been drinking dr*gs.
09x06,Unknown,"Well,"
09x06,Unknown,"I talked to Barney and Robin, and, let me say, I'm shocked."
09x06,Unknown,You should be.
09x06,Unknown,Flat-out lying to me like that?
09x06,Unknown,We are not misunderstanding each other.
09x06,Unknown,How dare you pretend their beautiful story is actually your own.
09x06,Unknown,Come again for Lil' Fudge?
09x06,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x06,Unknown,I understand the temptation.
09x06,Unknown,They're such a sweet couple.
09x06,Unknown,"I mean, the way they call each other Barnmallow and Robinpad."
09x06,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x06,Unknown,Oh.
09x06,LILY,Yes.
09x06,Unknown,I do steal their stories.
09x06,Unknown,Mm-hmm. But only because my husband and I are so ashamed of how we met.
09x06,Unknown,"See, we only met because his friend Ted fell in love with me."
09x06,Unknown,And who could blame him?
09x06,Unknown,"Hey, Marshall."
09x06,Unknown,See that girl?
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."
09x06,Unknown,You just know she likes it dirty.
09x06,Unknown,Go say hi. What?
09x06,Unknown,I can't just go say hi. I-I need a plan.
09x06,Unknown,Hmm.
09x06,Unknown,I'm gonna wait until she goes to the bathroom...
09x06,Unknown,Hi.
09x06,Unknown,Have you met Ted?
09x06,MARSHALL,"I'm sorry, I can't..."
09x06,LILY,"And now, after years of lying,"
09x06,Unknown,"cheating and backsliding, here we are, married!"
09x06,Unknown,But what can I say?
09x06,Unknown,"My husband's a sociopath who's slept with over a hundred women, and I'm a sl*t who once let my boss feel me up."
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, come on!"
09x06,Unknown,I felt
09x06,Unknown,him
09x06,Unknown,up! It is over 250 women!
09x06,Unknown,"If you two want to get married in my church, you'll stop breaking the ninth commandment."
09x06,Unknown,Uh... no fat chicks?
09x06,Unknown,Thou shalt not lie!
09x06,Unknown,With fat chicks?
09x06,Unknown,You're k*lling me. You're k*lling me.
09x06,Unknown,Now that... was a good dessert.
09x06,Unknown,(Cassie sighs)
09x06,Unknown,"""Dessert"" sounds like ""desert."""
09x06,Unknown,The desert has sand... there's sand at the beach... and Wesley and I once drove by a beach.
09x06,Unknown,(sobbing)
09x06,Unknown,Excuse me.
09x06,Unknown,(sobbing)
09x06,Unknown,Now's my chance to leave.
09x06,Unknown,"No, I'll wait five more seconds"
09x06,Unknown,so I don't seem too eager.
09x06,Unknown,Four... three... two...
09x06,Unknown,"Well, thanks for keeping our daughter company."
09x06,Unknown,"Man, she can be a real drag, huh?"
09x06,Unknown,We're gonna go have a little fun. See ya!
09x06,Unknown,(laughing)
09x06,Unknown,"You're on fire tonight, bro."
09x06,Unknown,"But, Lily, being a judge is my dream job."
09x06,DAPHNE'S VOICE,So your dream job is more important than my dream job?
09x06,Unknown,Exactly. Now you're getting it.
09x06,Unknown,(clucks tongue)
09x06,Unknown,Nope.
09x06,Unknown,Start over.
09x06,Unknown,So your dream job's more important than my dream job?
09x06,"But, baby, you already have the best job in the world",Mom. Nope.
09x06,Unknown,Start over.
09x06,Unknown,So your dream job's more important than my dream job?
09x06,Unknown,"Hey, I gave up peeing in the shower for you."
09x06,Unknown,Nope.
09x06,Unknown,Start over.
09x06,Unknown,So your dream job's more important than my dream job?
09x06,Unknown,Of course not.
09x06,Unknown,But this isn't just about our future.
09x06,Unknown,It's about everyone's.
09x06,Unknown,"As a lawyer, I couldn't stop big oil from polluting, but as a judge... well, maybe I can."
09x06,Unknown,And that's why I took the job.
09x06,Unknown,"You've just been ""convincered."""
09x06,Unknown,Wait.
09x06,Unknown,You already took the job?
09x06,Unknown,Without even talking to your wife?
09x06,Unknown,Start over.
09x06,Unknown,Start over... start over.
09x06,Unknown,What the damn hell?!
09x06,Unknown,"Hi, Reverend Lowell?"
09x06,Unknown,Whew. Made it through my half.
09x06,Unknown,You're up.
09x06,Unknown,Oh. Uh...
09x06,Unknown,"The-the truth is, we-we have a complicated, messy history that-that we're not too proud of."
09x06,Unknown,"But... we're sorry that we lied, and hope that you can forgive us."
09x06,Unknown,"Nope, I can't do it."
09x06,Unknown,You're going to have to find a new officiant.
09x06,Unknown,Okay.
09x06,Unknown,"Well, these things happen."
09x06,Unknown,And a new church.
09x06,Unknown,What the damn hell?!
09x06,Unknown,This evening could not get any worse.
09x06,Unknown,Whenever you're ready. Crap!
09x06,Unknown,"Hey, Ted."
09x06,Unknown,Thanks for being so great.
09x06,Unknown,I'm lucky to have you around this weekend.
09x06,Unknown,"Ooh, yeah..."
09x06,Unknown,About that...
09x06,Unknown,"I should really go see about the, uh..."
09x06,Unknown,"So, sex? My room is very close."
09x06,Unknown,(Cassie laughs)
09x06,TED,Sophia. Hi.
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, God. Wesley."
09x06,Unknown,"Wait. Wait, you're Wesley?"
09x06,Unknown,"Hey, Cassie."
09x06,Unknown,(laughs nervously)
09x06,Unknown,Your parents were just saying you have a new boyfriend.
09x06,Unknown,"""Boyfriend"" is a little premature."
09x06,Unknown,Though I did pay for dinner.
09x06,Unknown,Ted and I are very happy.
09x06,Unknown,Are we?
09x06,(crying),Even if... he'll never replace you.
09x06,Unknown,(sobbing)
09x06,Unknown,"So, Sophia. Hi."
09x06,Unknown,I'm Ted.
09x06,Unknown,Robin's friend.
09x06,Unknown,"What do you say we give these two old flames a chance to... catch up alone, and maybe you and I could go get a drink."
09x06,Unknown,Are you hitting on me? Dude!
09x06,Unknown,"Ted, let's go!"
09x06,Unknown,You tip...
09x06,Unknown,(scoffs)
09x06,Unknown,...poorly.
09x06,Unknown,"Look, I know. I shouldn't have taken the job without telling Lily."
09x06,Unknown,Why are you so ticked off about it?
09x06,Unknown,Because I know what she's going through.
09x06,Unknown,"I always dreamed of having a career I could be proud of, but my husband never supported me."
09x06,Unknown,"Eventually, I had to... make a choice."
09x06,Unknown,"Now, every day, I'm out there, I'm fighting for the good guys, and I love it."
09x06,Unknown,"Doesn't your wife deserve that, too?"
09x06,Unknown,"Wow. Um, maybe you're right."
09x06,Unknown,I didn't realize how many sacrifices you'd made.
09x06,Unknown,"What is it you do, anyway?"
09x06,Unknown,I'm a lobbyist for a big oil company.
09x06,Unknown,What the damn hell?!
09x06,Unknown,You know that I'm an environmentalist!
09x06,Unknown,That's why you don't want me to become a judge.
09x06,Unknown,But you're the reason I
09x06,Unknown,have
09x06,Unknown,to become a judge!
09x06,Unknown,You're the devil incarnate! And outcarnate!
09x06,Unknown,Every kind of carnate!
09x06,Unknown,"Please, is-is there any way you'd reconsider?"
09x06,Unknown,"No! No, no!"
09x06,Unknown,You two are both terrible people.
09x06,Unknown,Who found each other in this crazy world!
09x06,Unknown,Aw!
09x06,Unknown,And who lie about
09x06,Unknown,how
09x06,Unknown,they found each other.
09x06,Unknown,"So, please leave now. Just..."
09x06,Unknown,Ugh! Ugh!
09x06,Unknown,You know what? You're right.
09x06,Unknown,We shouldn't have lied about our story.
09x06,Unknown,I
09x06,Unknown,love
09x06,Unknown,our story.
09x06,Unknown,"Sure, it's messy, but it's the story that got us here, about to get married."
09x06,Unknown,"I love it, too."
09x06,Unknown,Every messy chapter.
09x06,Unknown,I love that you slept with over 250 women before deciding that I was your favorite.
09x06,Unknown,This is k*lling me.
09x06,Unknown,"And I love that we just had to keep having sex with each other, even when we were dating other people."
09x06,Unknown,This is
09x06,Unknown,really
09x06,Unknown,k*lling me.
09x06,Unknown,"And I love that your marriage proposal involved a strip club, lying to me, and pretending to bang the woman I"
09x06,Unknown,hate
09x06,Unknown,for two months.
09x06,Unknown,I love that we keep a running tally of all the different rooms we've had sex in.
09x06,Unknown,"I love that two weeks ago, we put this room on that list."
09x06,Unknown,"Huh? Come on, Rev."
09x06,Unknown,"That's got to be worth some kind of reaction, right?"
09x06,Unknown,"I mean, right where your hymnal is, is where we... we..."
09x06,Unknown,(laughs)
09x06,Unknown,"Well, that's not what you want."
09x06,Unknown,(crying and kissing)
09x06,Unknown,"(crying, sniffling, kissing)"
09x06,Unknown,"Um, are... are you okay?"
09x06,Unknown,I think... think maybe seeing your ex was a bit much for you.
09x06,Unknown,No. Not at all.
09x06,Unknown,I want... only you.
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."
09x06,Unknown,I want to... I want to rock your world.
09x06,Unknown,And you're so hot.
09x06,Unknown,(sniffling)
09x06,Unknown,I want to ride you like a bronco.
09x06,Unknown,(sobbing)
09x06,Unknown,"Okay, Cassie. Cassie."
09x06,Unknown,"Yeah, we... we can't do this."
09x06,Unknown,"I mean, you're crying."
09x06,Unknown,(coughing)
09x06,Unknown,And contagious.
09x06,Unknown,"You're-you're having a really, really bad week."
09x06,Unknown,I think... I think you should just take it easy.
09x06,Unknown,You're right.
09x06,Unknown,I'm not in a good place. No.
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, wow."
09x06,Unknown,I probably would have let you do all sorts of crazy things to me.
09x06,Unknown,(sighs)
09x06,Unknown,Exactly.
09x06,Unknown,I release you.
09x06,Unknown,Go have fun this weekend.
09x06,Unknown,Meet someone else.
09x06,Unknown,Yes! Yes! Be cool.
09x06,Unknown,Okay.
09x06,Unknown,But I couldn't meet someone else.
09x06,Unknown,"Hey, Ted? Yeah."
09x06,Unknown,Everyone here is saying you and Cassie are the couple of the weekend.
09x06,Unknown,How great is that?
09x06,Unknown,Barney was right.
09x06,Unknown,"I'd chosen poorly, everyone had seen us together, and now the whole weekend seemed lost."
09x06,Unknown,Until...
09x06,Unknown,Hi. I just got here.
09x06,Unknown,Did I miss anything?
09x06,Unknown,"Not at all. Grace, right?"
09x06,Unknown,I'm Ted. Let's get you a drink before you talk to anyone else or hear anything.
09x06,Unknown,"Hey, guys. How's your night going?"
09x06,Unknown,Ugh! Ugh!
09x06,Unknown,Our minister just died.
09x06,Unknown,"Wh...? We can still use the church, but we only have two days to find a new officiant."
09x06,Unknown,Unless...
09x06,BARNEY,Wedding at Bernie's!
09x06,Unknown,We're not doing Wedding at Bernie's!
09x06,Unknown,"Wow. Oh, that's terrible."
09x06,Unknown,Should I make a toast in his honor?
09x06,(whispers),No.
09x06,Unknown,Of course I should.
09x06,Unknown,Everyone?
09x06,Unknown,To Reverend Lowell.
09x06,Unknown,"He may have passed away tonight, but he will always..."
09x06,Unknown,Uncle Robert died?!
09x06,Unknown,"Oh, no."
09x06,Unknown,(crying)
09x06,Unknown,(high-pitched crying)
09x06,Unknown,(sobbing)
09x06,Unknown,Have a nice weekend.
09x06,Unknown,"All that night, I did nothing but choose poorly."
09x06,Unknown,"But thanks to Cassie, I didn't get together with anyone at that wedding."
09x06,Unknown,"And if I had, well, then, your mother and I might never have met."
09x06,Unknown,"So, maybe, in a way, I chose wisely."
09x06,SOPHIA,Boo-uh! Boo-uh! Eee!
09x06,Unknown,"Although, it sure as heck didn't feel like it at the time."
09x06,Unknown,Aah! Aah! Aah!
09x06,Unknown,(sighs)
09x06,Unknown,She chose...
09x06,Unknown,Wesley.
09x06,Unknown,(chuckling)
09x06,Unknown,I've been dying to say that one all night.
09x06,Unknown,"Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you."
09x06,Unknown,"The truth is, you're right."
09x06,Unknown,It was wrong of me to take that job without telling Lily.
09x06,Unknown,I don't need to be tough with her. I need to be fair.
09x06,Unknown,"Thanks, Marshall. Mm."
09x06,Unknown,I should also apologize.
09x06,Unknown,"While you were filling the t*nk, I may have been so angry, I texted your wife with the news that you took that judge offer."
09x06,Unknown,(phone ringing)
09x06,Unknown,Don't forget to compliment her hair.
09x07,Unknown,"Kids, as you know, Lily and Marshall had decided to move to Rome after Barney and Robin's wedding."
09x07,Unknown,We're going to Italy.
09x07,Unknown,"Sì. But without telling Lily, Marshall had then accepted a judgeship in New York."
09x07,Unknown,Good luck with that... Your Honor.
09x07,Unknown,Until his always-helpful road trip companion Daphne had selflessly
09x07,Unknown,(phone ringing)
09x07,Unknown,come to his aid.
09x07,Unknown,You texted Lily that I took the job?
09x07,Unknown,You're welcome.
09x07,Unknown,"You were torturing yourself figuring out how to tell her, I just broke the ice for you."
09x07,Unknown,I was standing on that ice.
09x07,Unknown,"Now I'm gonna be bobbing, facedown on a frigid creek."
09x07,Unknown,I do not need to know the nasty way you apologize to your wife.
09x07,Unknown,And frigid? Maybe you're just doing it wrong.
09x07,Unknown,"Hi, baby."
09x07,Unknown,I can't believe you did this behind my back.
09x07,Unknown,"I know, I should have talked to you."
09x07,Unknown,"Thanks to you, we are stuck all weekend in the room with a ghost in it."
09x07,Unknown,Room with a...?
09x07,Unknown,We got 13?
09x07,Unknown,The room that's haunted by the ghost of Captain Dearduff?

09x07,Unknown,"Marshall had recently discovered that the Farhampton Inn was featured in an episode of The Ghost Network's original series,"
09x07,Unknown,True & Real Ghost Stories of the Supernatural.
09x07,Unknown,"Ooh, there, see?"
09x07,Unknown,The Farhampton Inn.
09x07,Unknown,I told you it sounded familiar.
09x07,Unknown,"In 1843, the streets of Farhampton, Long Island were stalked by a vicious k*ller named Captain Blazeby Dearduff."
09x07,Unknown,"Dubbed ""Dearduff the Hooker,"" he m*rder*d dozens of unwary travelers with his sharpened hook."
09x07,Unknown,Ironically that hook would prove Dearduff's own undoing
09x07,Unknown,(laughing maniacally)
09x07,Unknown,one wintry night in room 13 of the Farhampton Inn.
09x07,Unknown,(fly buzzing)
09x07,Unknown,(grunting)
09x07,Unknown,(yells)
09x07,Unknown,Uh-oh.
09x07,Unknown,"He was found the next morning, frozen to death."
09x07,MAN,Boom!
09x07,Unknown,Some say you can still hear Captain Dearduff's cries coming from room 13.
09x07,Unknown,Cold.
09x07,Unknown,So cold.
09x07,Unknown,Help me... help me...
09x07,MAN,"We can see you, Ron."
09x07,Unknown,Some say you can still hear the thump of his peg and the scrape of his hook.
09x07,Unknown,Others say Dearduff the Hooker was just a popular male prost*tute who m*rder*d no one and died of syphilis in 1848.
09x07,Unknown,Let's hear from some people who have actually survived a night in room 13.
09x07,Unknown,(thunder crashing)
09x07,Unknown,Did I see a ghost?
09x07,Unknown,Yes.
09x07,Unknown,There's...
09x07,Unknown,Are.
09x07,Unknown,...such thing as ghosts.
09x07,Unknown,(Dearduff laughing maniacally)
09x07,Unknown,"So, have you seen the ghost?"
09x07,Unknown,"Not yet, but that might just be because ghosts don't exist, Marshall!"
09x07,Unknown,So explain the night shirt we saw flying around our cabin in the Poconos.
09x07,Unknown,An owl got stuck in it.
09x07,Unknown,We saw it fly out the neck hole.
09x07,Unknown,"Yeah, the ghost of an owl that died in that cabin."
09x07,Unknown,"Plus it's a crappy room, but when I tried to complain..."
09x07,Unknown,The thermostat in my room is broken.
09x07,Unknown,The AC won't turn off.
09x07,Unknown,Ooh!
09x07,Unknown,Sounds like the work of Captain Dearduff.
09x07,Unknown,He brings with him the icy chill of death.
09x07,Unknown,So... bad luck there.
09x07,Unknown,Night-night.
09x07,Unknown,It sounds like you're using Captain Dearduff as an excuse for a crappy room.
09x07,Unknown,I beg your pardon.
09x07,Unknown,I did not get to be a 40-year-old night clerk by making excuses.
09x07,Unknown,"Now, if there is anything wrong with your room that isn't ghost-related, I'm more than happy to address it."
09x07,Unknown,"Okay, the Wi-Fi doesn't work."
09x07,Unknown,Ghosts interfere with electronic devices.
09x07,Unknown,The shower's leaking.
09x07,Unknown,Dearduff likes the sound of dripping.
09x07,Unknown,Reminds him of his bleeding victims.
09x07,Unknown,And the door won't lock.
09x07,Unknown,"Captain Dearduff doesn't want to... you know, be locked out of his room."
09x07,Unknown,Why would a locked door keep a ghost out?
09x07,Unknown,Can't he just walk through walls?
09x07,Unknown,Maybe he's afraid of rats.
09x07,Unknown,There are rats in the walls?
09x07,Unknown,No.
09x07,Unknown,"And the inn's booked up because of the wedding, so we can't change rooms."
09x07,Unknown,"Oh, that sucks."
09x07,Unknown,"I'm sorry, baby."
09x07,Unknown,"Hey... but if Dearduff does manifest, you know the proper way to harvest ectoplasm, right?"
09x07,Unknown,(phone beeps)
09x07,Unknown,"Hey, good news-- we're all set for the dove release."
09x07,Unknown,"The what? When we leave the church, they're gonna release a hundred doves."
09x07,Unknown,It's gonna be avi-wait-for-it-ary.
09x07,Unknown,Aviary!
09x07,Unknown,Oh.
09x07,Unknown,That might be a problem. Why?
09x07,Unknown,"Because when we leave the church, a few of the g*n enthusiasts in my family are gonna fire a 21-g*n salute."

09x07,Unknown,"I know. You were a ""Priority Male."""
09x07,Unknown,You said you'd stop doing that joke after the editor of Bazooka Joe comics rejected it.
09x07,Unknown,That man is a comedy snob.

09x07,Unknown,The drainpipe! What?
09x07,Unknown,"There's a drainpipe that runs up near her window, and, no big deal, I can totally climb it."
09x07,Unknown,I'll call you when it's done.
09x07,Unknown,Her door is unlock...
09x07,Unknown,(click)
09x07,Unknown,Uh...
09x07,Unknown,Marshall wanted me to check on you.
09x07,Unknown,He was worried that you might be scared all alone in the ghost room.
09x07,Unknown,Remind me to call you next time Marvin has a nightmare... you can calm him by bursting into his room with a chain saw and a hockey mask!
09x07,Unknown,"Sorry, I didn't want to knock in case you were already asleep, so I just climbed the drainpipe up to your window."
09x07,Unknown,"No big deal. Mm, opened the latch with this here coat hanger."
09x07,Unknown,"I would have called, but, uh... well, I didn't know if you'd have your phone handy."

09x07,Unknown,Where is she?
09x07,Unknown,"All right, I'll take a lap dance."
09x07,Unknown,Can I borrow some sweatpants?
09x07,(whispers),"Barney, what are you doing in there?"
09x07,Unknown,"Marshall asked me to do something for him, no questions asked."
09x07,Unknown,Sidebar-- I forgot to get my cousin David something for his bar mitzvah last week.
09x07,Unknown,Could you send the hooker to his room?
09x07,Unknown,"Wait, Marshall called you, too?"
09x07,Unknown,Turns out I wasn't Marshall's first call.

09x07,Unknown,That's the problem with us-- we don't think about checking in with the other person before doing something.
09x07,Unknown,"Honestly, I think that's what broke us up the first time."
09x07,Unknown,We're both... lone wolves... always off in our own worlds.

09x07,Unknown,I just won 50 bucks from a little Irish guy on a dare.

09x07,Unknown,Easy. The lock on her door is busted...
09x07,Unknown,Air ducts! What?
09x07,Unknown,"I'll use the system of air ducts to get in her room, just like the bad guy in"

09x07,Unknown,Die H...
09x07,Unknown,"Not important. The point is, the door is not lock..."
09x07,Unknown,I'll call you when it's done.
09x07,ROBIN,"Anyway, I was saying, I think we need to be better about talking to each other before doing stuff."
09x07,Unknown,Can't talk. Doing stuff.

09x07,Unknown,Uh... uh... uh... The kinkajou... the kinkajou...

09x07,Unknown,"Oh, God, what is it now?"
09x07,Unknown,"Good evening, Ms. Aldrin."
09x07,Unknown,I didn't order room service.
09x07,Unknown,"It says right here, room 13."
09x07,Unknown,"Lobster, caviar, champagne."
09x07,Unknown,$400?!
09x07,Unknown,I didn't order any of this.
09x07,Unknown,Maybe Dearduff the Hooker ordered it.
09x07,Unknown,"Well, I'm not paying for room service the Hooker ordered!"
09x07,I've been there. LILY,"Okay, you know what? I need to talk to the manager."

09x07,Unknown,Cold has a plumping effect.
09x07,Unknown,"Second, you owe me a ""No Questions Asked."""
09x07,Unknown,"All right, I'm-I'm at the alley near 22nd and 2nd. Now what?"
09x07,ROBIN,No questions asked. Tell me about that giant trout you and your dad caught ice-fishing that one time.
09x07,Unknown,"Well, it was more beast than trout."
09x07,Unknown,Fought us for three hours and nearly dragged us both into Lake Winnibigoshish.
09x07,Unknown,"It was this big, and..."
09x07,Unknown,(grunts)
09x07,Unknown,Hey.
09x07,Unknown,Run!
09x07,Unknown,"I never asked you who those weirdos were, why they kept calling you Night Falcon or even what was in those darts that they were blowing at us."

09x07,Unknown,(sighs)
09x07,Unknown,Wuss.
09x07,Unknown,"Fine, I'll take care of it."
09x07,Unknown,Just have to figure out how to get into Lily's room.
09x07,Unknown,Her door doesn't lock. You can just...
09x07,Unknown,Room service!
09x07,Unknown,"Night Falcon, you're a genius."
09x07,Unknown,I'll call you when it's done.
09x07,Unknown,"Why would he call you guys before me? Well, dude, you're not great in a crisis."
09x07,Unknown,What was that story you were prattling on about?
09x07,Unknown,What the hell is a kinkajou?
09x07,Unknown,"Okay, let's just find it before she gets back."
09x07,Unknown,"I'm sorry, ma'am."
09x07,Unknown,"You ordered it, so you have to pay for it."
09x07,Unknown,Not to mention the room damage you're responsible for.
09x07,I've got a report here,"broken lock, faulty Wi-Fi, you've taken several items from the minibar..."
09x07,Unknown,There is no minibar.
09x07,Unknown,Stolen minibar.
09x07,Unknown,It's not here.
09x07,Unknown,"Well, where else would it be?"
09x07,Unknown,Okay.
09x07,Unknown,I think it's time I call my lawyer.
09x07,Unknown,Uh-oh.
09x07,Unknown,"Okay, we need to get to Lily's phone before she sees that text."
09x07,Unknown,I'm on it. Night Falcon is on it.
09x07,Unknown,Good thing I packed my unitard.
09x07,Unknown,(groans)
09x07,Unknown,(panting)
09x07,Unknown,"This is exactly what we always do, isn't it?"
09x07,Unknown,Yeah.
09x07,Unknown,We were both gonna bolt off and lone wolf it without telling the other person a thing.
09x07,Unknown,Why do we do that? I don't know.
09x07,Unknown,Maybe we're just incapable of working as a unit.
09x07,Unknown,(sighs)
09x07,Unknown,You know...
09x07,Unknown,I bet even lone wolves can learn to work together.
09x07,Unknown,I'd like to think so.
09x07,Unknown,They could build their little woodland den together.
09x07,Unknown,Roam together.
09x07,Unknown,Hunt together.
09x07,Unknown,Lure prey into a tight corner and...
09x07,BOTH,Snap its limbs with our powerful jaws and watch the life drain from its eyes.
09x07,BOTH,Aw...
09x07,Unknown,"Point is, we're gonna make a great team."
09x07,Unknown,We'll just need some practice.
09x07,Unknown,"Yeah. Yeah, let's prove that we believe in marriage by working together to help Marshall hide something from his wife."
09x07,Unknown,"First, we take position in the lobby."
09x07,Unknown,Then you cause a distraction.
09x07,Unknown,(silenced g*nsh*t)
09x07,Unknown,(vase shatters)
09x07,Unknown,Then you send in a trained dove to grab Lily's phone.
09x07,Unknown,The dove drops the phone into your hand.
09x07,Unknown,You delete the text and toss it back on the counter.
09x07,Unknown,♪
09x07,Unknown,Wait.
09x07,Unknown,(sighs)
09x07,Unknown,It's absolutely insane...
09x07,Unknown,...how foolproof this plan is!
09x07,Unknown,Sometimes it's best to just go simple.
09x07,Unknown,Yep.
09x07,Unknown,(coughing)
09x07,Unknown,Wh-Why do you have a g*n?
09x07,Unknown,Why do you always have a g*n?
09x07,(quietly),Where's Lily?
09x07,Unknown,She went up 20 minutes ago.
09x07,Unknown,You're kidding.
09x07,Unknown,"Courtney Dove, no!"
09x07,Unknown,I already lost Kurt Coo-bain!
09x07,Unknown,I can't lose you as well.
09x07,Unknown,Great. How are we gonna get Lily's phone back now?

09x07,Unknown,"You are never gonna believe this, but... (phone chimes)"
09x07,Unknown,"Uh, someone sent me a text."
09x07,TED,"Lily, stop!"
09x07,Unknown,Why?
09x07,Unknown,Because... because...
09x07,Unknown,And that's when I realized that the answer had been there all along.
09x07,Unknown,Throw your phone on the ground and smash it with your foot.
09x07,Unknown,What? No. I need you to do this no questions asked.
09x07,Unknown,"You owe me a ""No Questions Asked."""
09x07,Unknown,"Hey, Lil. What's... Ted, I need you to come to my classroom right now with two dozen cupcakes and a box cutter."
09x07,Unknown,No questions asked.
09x07,Unknown,"Lily, I brought the..."
09x07,Unknown,"Oh-oh, my God."
09x07,Unknown,"Ted, put the cupcakes at the feet of their leader, then cut me loose."
09x07,Unknown,Don't make eye contact!

09x07,Unknown,Ted...
09x07,Unknown,No... questions... asked.
09x07,Unknown,(Lily stomping)
09x07,Unknown,"Ninth, as I found out later, but I won't go into it."
09x07,Unknown,The important thing is what happened right after the untimely death of Lily's phone.
09x07,Unknown,So you're saying you didn't order room service and you didn't order
09x07,Unknown,Prison Sluts Nine?
09x07,Unknown,I am saying I did not order room service.
09x07,Unknown,It is done. By me.
09x07,Unknown,Your third call.
09x07,Unknown,"Actually, you were..."
09x07,Unknown,Thank you. H-How did you do it?
09x07,Unknown,"I called in a ""No Questions Asked"" with Lily."
09x07,Unknown,"But, wait, why didn't you do that?"
09x07,Unknown,"You must have, like, a million of those."
09x07,Unknown,And Marshall thought back.
09x07,Unknown,Hello?
09x07,Unknown,"Hey, baby, it's me."
09x07,Unknown,"Um, can you come bail me out of jail?"
09x07,Unknown,"I thought I saw Bigfoot in Central Park and so I tackled him, but it turned out to be Russell Brand."
09x07,Unknown,Hey...
09x07,Unknown,"Oh, do you mind looking up our vaccination records?"
09x07,Unknown,I tried to hug a raccoon.
09x07,Unknown,"Hey, babe, um, could you dig up our warranty?"
09x07,Unknown,"I took the TV apart, and I made a robot out of it."
09x07,Unknown,(phone rings)
09x07,Unknown,Hello?
09x07,Unknown,Hey.
09x07,Unknown,I tackled Russell Brand again.
09x07,Unknown,I've never asked Lily to do anything no questions asked because...
09x07,Unknown,I've never wanted to.

09x08,Unknown,Just consoling.
09x08,Unknown,"Yeah, that's not happening."

09x08,Unknown,"Oh, stupid, huh?"
09x08,Unknown,That's great.
09x08,Unknown,I guess Daphne gets to pick the music and crap all over my fun road-trip games.
09x08,Unknown,"(sighs) You know, maybe Clint was right."
09x08,Unknown,Maybe we do need conflict resolution.
09x08,Unknown,I knew you guys would come around.
09x08,Unknown,(Daphne and Marshall screaming)
09x08,Unknown,And so I made up my mind to settle for Cassie.
09x08,Unknown,"So, um, what kind of music do you like?"
09x08,Unknown,Hmm... nothing.
09x08,Unknown,"Still, I felt optimistic."

09x08,Unknown,"So, today, we're gonna build a new paradigm of understanding, and then you're gonna swoop me on back to Shaker Heights."

09x08,Unknown,"If you don't even know how to make scrambled eggs, I just worry what kind of breakfast you're gonna be serving my grandchildren."
09x08,Unknown,"Well, lucky you because that is one thing you won't ever have to worry about."
09x08,Unknown,"Mom, Robin can't have kids."
09x08,Unknown,"Every single job I take on, it's always the same!"

09x08,Unknown,I'm just sick of it. I'm si...
09x08,Unknown,"Ow. Ow. Oh, I can hear my blood right now."
09x08,Unknown,I'm having an attack. I'm having a blood attack.
09x08,Unknown,A blood attack?
09x08,Unknown,Yeah. Pull over. I need... I-I need to meditate.
09x08,Unknown,I got to get my heart rate down. I'll... Ow! Pull over.

09x08,Unknown,God...
09x08,Unknown,Robin can't have kids?
09x08,Unknown,But you always wanted children.
09x08,Unknown,"No, I always"
09x08,Unknown,liked
09x08,Unknown,children.
09x08,Unknown,I've always
09x08,Unknown,wanted

09x08,Unknown,"God, I wish that existed."
09x08,Unknown,So no grandkids.
09x08,Unknown,How long have you known about this?
09x08,Unknown,I found out last fall.
09x08,Unknown,Robin and I had been hanging out downtown at this very cool secret bar.
09x08,Unknown,(dance music playing)
09x08,Unknown,What a lovely place!
09x08,Unknown,Have you ever had sushi that fresh?
09x08,Unknown,"Okay, I am never getting on a mechanical bull again."
09x08,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x08,Unknown,I can't believe Marshall and Lily missed out.
09x08,Unknown,"Promise me, if you ever have kids, you'll sometimes get a babysitter and come have an epic night."
09x08,Unknown,"Oh, and, P.S., bring the babysitter, she sounds dirty."
09x08,Unknown,"Actually, I, uh, I can't have kids, so that's not an issue."
09x08,Unknown,Really?
09x08,Unknown,Yeah.
09x08,Unknown,Is it weird that I'm hugging you like this?
09x08,Unknown,"No, it's not weird."
09x08,Unknown,"Now it's weird. Mm-hmm. Yep, the rain makes it weird."
09x08,Unknown,"Mom, I'm not marrying some future possibility of starting a family."
09x08,Unknown,I'm marrying a girl.
09x08,Unknown,Who means more to me than kids.
09x08,Unknown,Or my career.
09x08,Unknown,"Or even the Lambor-cuzzi, patent pending."
09x08,Unknown,So please...
09x08,Unknown,...be nice to her?
09x08,Unknown,This is ridiculous.
09x08,Unknown,Get out there and drag Clint's downward-facing ass back in here so we can get going.
09x08,Unknown,Just let him do his thing.
09x08,Unknown,(sighs)
09x08,Unknown,Do you know why the Daphnes of the world always get to pick the music and the Marshalls pay all the tolls?
09x08,Unknown,"Because the Marshalls are so concerned with letting everybody do their thing, and the Daphnes are taking care of Daphne."
09x08,Unknown,"You can talk to me about solar or wind or hydro-whatever, but the world is always gonna push you around, Marshall."

09x08,Unknown,She's not coming.
09x08,Unknown,What?
09x08,Unknown,I finally got a hold of her.
09x08,Unknown,"She, um, never got on the plane."
09x08,Unknown,She was too scared.
09x08,Unknown,She won't be at her daughter's wedding.
09x08,Unknown,(bell dings)
09x08,Unknown,"(""Try a Little Tenderness"" by Otis Redding playing)"
09x08,Unknown,If that is the case... can we tell Barney she's super fat?
09x08,Unknown,It would mean the world to me.
09x08,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x08,Unknown,Of course.
09x08,Unknown,"Oh, here we go."
09x08,Unknown,"Listen, Robin... Loretta, not now. Robin just found out her mom's not coming to the wedding."

09x08,Unknown,Okay.
09x08,Unknown,Mom.
09x08,Unknown,I'm sorry. Sometimes I get...
09x08,Unknown,...carried away.
09x08,Unknown,"Your eggs are great, by the way."
09x08,Unknown,"Oh, mama,"
09x08,Unknown,that was some bad advice.
09x08,Unknown,"Thanks, Lil."
09x08,Unknown,But you know what sucks?
09x08,Unknown,"When I was at the top of that lighthouse, despite everything else..."
09x08,Unknown,Wow. It's like traveling back in time.
09x08,Unknown,Just stop talking.
09x08,Unknown,(sighs)
09x08,Unknown,...it was breathtaking.
09x08,Unknown,And I wasted it.
09x08,Unknown,"I mean, how many places have I ruined forever by being there with the wrong girl?"
09x08,Unknown,So come back with the right girl.
09x08,Unknown,I don't know.
09x08,Unknown,I'm starting to think a person gets a certain allotment of lighthouses per lifetime.
09x08,Unknown,And I've used all mine up.
09x08,Unknown,"And that, kids, is the kind of stupid thing you say before you've met the person who hits the reset button on the world, who makes everything new again, who makes it seem ridiculous that you ever considered settling, because not two years later..."
09x08,Unknown,Look at that.
09x08,Unknown,It's like traveling back in time.
09x08,Unknown,That is exactly what I said.
09x08,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x08,Unknown,Why couldn't it have been you here with me two years ago?
09x08,Unknown,That's probably for the best.
09x08,Unknown,"When you vomit, I vomit."
09x08,Unknown,You know that.
09x08,Unknown,"(chuckles) Well, thanks for being here with me now."
09x08,Unknown,Thanks for bringing me.
09x08,Unknown,Wow.
09x08,Unknown,It is just bonkers beautiful here.

09x09,Unknown,It's fun. Tickets are cheap. Gets us out of the house.
09x09,Unknown,"No, me and Robin."

09x09,Unknown,Are you serious? Robin told you that she's still in love with me?
09x09,Unknown,"No, I just made that up."

09x09,Unknown,"You passed my test, girl."
09x09,Unknown,No.
09x09,Unknown,Just... no.
09x09,Unknown,I told her I'm a method actor.
09x09,Unknown,And I had to get plastic surgery for an upcoming role where I play a man much more handsome than myself.
09x09,Unknown,"Congratulations, you win."
09x09,Unknown,"Win? No, I don't want to win."
09x09,Unknown,I want to keep playing. More challenges.
09x09,Unknown,"Fine, you want another challenge?"

09x09,Unknown,Sounds like an errand.
09x09,Unknown,While picking up a girl.
09x09,Unknown,Challenge accepted!
09x09,Unknown,Come on!
09x09,Unknown,Whatever happened to the guy who wasn't afraid to charge headlong into the unknown?
09x09,Unknown,What unknown?
09x09,Unknown,"Sure, eight years ago when I stole that blue French horn, yeah."
09x09,Unknown,That was the unknown.
09x09,Unknown,"But now? I mean, how many times have we been here?"
09x09,Unknown,I know exactly what's gonna happen.
09x09,Unknown,"You know who else knew exactly what was gonna happen, Ted?"
09x09,Unknown,"The Washington Generals on January 5, 1971."
09x09,Unknown,"They knew they were gonna lose, but they went in there anyway, and then gave it their best shot."
09x09,Unknown,"And they won that game, Ted!"
09x09,Unknown,For one reason and for one reason only.
09x09,Unknown,A scoring error and the fact that Curly Neal had the flu?
09x09,Unknown,Perseverance.
09x09,Unknown,"It was the only win in Generals history, but that's all"

09x09,Unknown,"Hello, Ted, it's Hammond Druthers."
09x09,Unknown,Target acquired.
09x09,Unknown,I'm recruiting volunteers for the starving puppy orphanage where I work.
09x09,Unknown,For free.
09x09,Unknown,"So, if you wouldn't mind just writing your number down on this signup sheet...?"
09x09,Unknown,"Listen, I appreciate that you feel like you need my number."
09x09,Unknown,Um.
09x09,Unknown,Maybe it's because you're really sad about something and this is your way of feeling better about yourself.
09x09,Unknown,"But... since I have a boyfriend, and I'm pretty sure I heard you call me a target earlier over there, Wha...? I'm gonna go ahead and not give you my number."
09x09,Unknown,I'm gonna give you something even better.
09x09,Unknown,"Wow, right to the chase."
09x09,Unknown,Meet you in aisle six.
09x09,Unknown,I'm gonna give you this. Okay.

09x09,Unknown,Excuse me.
09x09,Unknown,"What do you mean ""sad""?"
09x09,Unknown,Ted?
09x09,Unknown,"I'm calling you from Chicago, Illinois where I'm a key player in a very successful architectural firm."
09x09,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, I read about that."
09x09,Unknown,"All right, about what you read..."
09x09,Unknown,You built that big concave glass tower.
09x09,Unknown,And it melted a few buildings across the street.
09x09,Unknown,"Yes, fine, but come on."
09x09,Unknown,What architect hasn't made a major design flaw that raised the temperature of the city aquarium to 190 degrees and k*lled thousands of very rare fish?
09x09,Unknown,"That's the past, Ted. I'm looking forward."
09x09,Unknown,I want you on my team.
09x09,Unknown,And I won't take no for an answer.
09x09,Unknown,"No. I don't think you heard me, Ted."
09x09,Unknown,"No. Come on, Ted!"
09x09,Unknown,Please?
09x09,Unknown,They're gonna give me a parking spot if you say yes.
09x09,Unknown,"Do I get a parking spot? Well, we can go tandem."
09x09,Unknown,No. Every other week then?
09x09,Unknown,No.
09x09,Unknown,"You know, Chicago's more of a walking town."
09x09,Unknown,No. All right!
09x09,Unknown,You can have the parking spot.
09x09,Unknown,"So, that's a yes?"
09x09,Unknown,"Mm, no. Look, Ted."
09x09,Unknown,I can make your life very difficult.
09x09,Unknown,How? How?!
09x09,Unknown,I will call you a lot.
09x09,Unknown,I will Tweet at you like crazy.
09x09,Unknown,I will live on your Facebook wall!
09x09,Unknown,We're not Facebook friends.
09x09,Unknown,"Yeah, what's going on with that?"
09x09,Unknown,"It's been pending, like, for eight months now."
09x09,Unknown,"Look, Ted, you're a... a very hot commodity."
09x09,Unknown,Everybody loves the GNB Tower.
09x09,Unknown,And how it hasn't blinded any pilots on final approach into O'Hare.
09x09,Unknown,(laughs)
09x09,Unknown,"And I-I may have told the partners here that you and I are very, very good friends."
09x09,Unknown,"So, please, just say that you'll think about it."
09x09,Unknown,Fine.
09x09,Unknown,I'll think about it.
09x09,Unknown,"Druthers sh**t, he scores!"
09x09,Unknown,"Sad? Lady, I got 14 girls' numbers in the last hour."
09x09,Unknown,And this was an off night.
09x09,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x09,Unknown,What can I possibly be sad about?
09x09,Unknown,I think you were in love and you messed it up.
09x09,Unknown,And every moment of your life since then has been spent trying to stay busy enough to ignore that fact.
09x09,Unknown,And that's how Barney met your mother.
09x09,Unknown,"Well, the Generals lost."
09x09,Unknown,What a nail biter... the whole fourth quarter my heart was in my throat.
09x09,Unknown,What was the final?
09x09,Unknown,216 to 12.
09x09,Unknown,"Nobody talk to me right now, I can't even..."
09x09,Unknown,The strangest thing happened at the game.
09x09,Unknown,I got a phone call from an unknown number.
09x09,Unknown,And when I answered I...
09x09,Unknown,You're eating olives.
09x09,Unknown,Yup.
09x09,Unknown,Do you want these?
09x09,Unknown,I hate olives.
09x09,Unknown,I... thought you hate olives.

09x09,Unknown,"Hello, partner!"
09x09,Unknown,"Boy, that just sounds right, doesn't it?"
09x09,Unknown,"Yeah, actually, Mr. Druthers."
09x09,Unknown,My answer is no.
09x09,Unknown,"What? No, Ted, come on!"
09x09,Unknown,"I'm sorry, I still have things to do here in New York."
09x09,Unknown,I am going to build a tower of glass and melt you with it!
09x09,Unknown,"No, you won't. No, I won't, but know this."
09x09,Unknown,After today this offer is gone forever.
09x09,Unknown,"When I hang up this phone, you and I are done."
09x09,Unknown,The door is closed! Okay.
09x09,Unknown,"The door's always open, Ted."
09x09,Unknown,"If you change your mind, just call me back, okay?"
09x09,Unknown,Bye.
09x09,Unknown,I think he's coming around.
09x09,Unknown,We tried dating a while back and it was a disaster.
09x09,Unknown,But I-I always regret giving up.

09x09,Unknown,Hmm.

09x10,Unknown,"You're jealous I got the Best Mansmanship back,"
09x10,Unknown,so you destroyed that photo as part of some diabolical scheme to make me look bad.
09x10,Unknown,I bet you even found some other photo of Wayne Gretzky

09x10,Unknown,You're insane. Am I?

09x10,Unknown,You complained about me?
09x10,Unknown,No.
09x10,Unknown,"So, Claude..."
09x10,Unknown,I see that you're a Montreal Canadiens fan.
09x10,Unknown,"Which means you hate the Edmonton Oilers, which is why you destroyed the Wayne Gretzky head shot!"

09x10,Unknown,"ridicule,"
09x10,Unknown,how do you explain this?
09x10,Unknown,"Ah, seems like I've caught you... midnight blue-handed."
09x10,Unknown,"Oh, these. Yeah."
09x10,Unknown,"I-I was out by the water when... an elderly R-Rastafarian hang glider... he-he crash onto a beached squid, which squirted ink when I ran in to help."

09x10,Unknown,"Sorry, Claude."
09x10,Unknown,De rien.
09x10,Unknown,I don't get it.
09x10,Unknown,We were bonding.
09x10,Unknown,I can't think of anything I did wrong!
09x10,Unknown,"Okay, I did a few things wrong."
09x10,Unknown,"For the last time, I did not leave the bag of oranges you bought on the roof!"
09x10,Unknown,"No more breaking the speed limit. And, uh, thanks for flagging me down and telling me she was going 67."
09x10,Unknown,"Just following the rules, Officer."
09x10,Unknown,Oh. She's also not wearing her seat belt.
09x10,Unknown,You are not allowed to use that word!
09x10,Unknown,Only
09x10,Unknown,we're
09x10,Unknown,allowed to use that word!
09x10,Unknown,I am so sorry.
09x10,Unknown,I will never call you or anyone else a...
09x10,Unknown,Trekkie again.
09x10,Unknown,But I apologized and you accepted.
09x10,Unknown,I even bought you more oranges.
09x10,Unknown,"Look, it wasn't you, okay?"
09x10,Unknown,"Baby, I know your speech at the Model U.N. is a big deal, but I'm just not sure I'll make it in time."
09x10,Unknown,I'm trying.
09x10,Unknown,You know what?
09x10,Unknown,Don't bother coming.
09x10,Unknown,"So, back at the airport, that story was true?"
09x10,Unknown,You have a daughter?
09x10,Unknown,She lives with her dad.
09x10,Unknown,"And since I travel for work, I miss a lot of stuff."
09x10,Unknown,I only work as hard as I do to provide for her.
09x10,Unknown,"But kids, they don't understand logic."
09x10,Unknown,Kids understand who shows up.
09x10,Unknown,That's why her dad's her hero... and I get hung up on.
09x10,Unknown,Go see your daughter's speech.
09x10,Unknown,"If you show up, all will be forgiven."
09x10,Unknown,Just drop it.
09x10,Unknown,And drop me at home.
09x10,Unknown,Then head out to your wedding.
09x10,Unknown,End of discussion.
09x10,Unknown,"Barney, even if your plan worked, you'd be destroying your dad's marriage."
09x10,Unknown,"Okay, you may have a point."
09x10,Unknown,Can I suggest something?
09x10,Unknown,(sighs)
09x10,Unknown,Truce?
09x10,Unknown,We both agree to drop this.
09x10,Unknown,Agreed.
09x10,Unknown,"Hey, I got a replacement bottle of 30-year Glen McKenna. Okay."
09x10,Unknown,"Look, even if Mom never gets back together with either one of our dads, we're still brothers."
09x10,Unknown,It's not a competition.

09x10,Unknown,"One on, one off?"
09x10,Unknown,What the hell is going on here?
09x10,Unknown,"After you boys tracked Sam down a few years back, we got in touch. We became friends again, started hanging out. And then one day, she went from being Loretta to being..."
09x10,Unknown,Lo-ret-ta.
09x10,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x10,Unknown,"We wanted to wait to tell you because it's still new, but it was inevitable you'd find out once Sam came to perform the ceremony."
09x10,Unknown,Is that what you two call it?
09x10,Unknown,"""Performing the ceremony""?"
09x10,Unknown,"Oh, Sam's marrying you tomorrow, dear."
09x10,Unknown,"Right. Thank you, Reverend. Look, is there any way you guys can be all right with this?"
09x10,Unknown,Of course I am!
09x10,Unknown,(clears throat)
09x10,Unknown,Barney?
09x10,Unknown,"I know I've been acting crazy today, but..."
09x10,Unknown,"I just have one real question, Mom, and I want an honest answer."
09x10,Unknown,Is there a scenario... and hear me out... where you might consider doing kind of a three-way deal with both of our dads?
09x10,Unknown,"God! What is wrong with you?! Oh, dude, come on!"
09x10,Unknown,(sobs)
09x10,Unknown,That's what I thought!
09x10,Unknown,"It's time to admit it, Ted."
09x10,Unknown,You spilled the ink. There's no conspiracy.
09x10,Unknown,I guess you're right.
09x10,Unknown,"I mean, the only other person who saw Barney give me that photo... was you."
09x10,Unknown,(dramatic sting)
09x10,Unknown,Hey. Idiot.
09x10,Unknown,"While you've been playing detective, I've been cleaning up your mess."
09x10,Unknown,"Look, the ink remover works."
09x10,Unknown,I'm gonna finish this.
09x10,Unknown,You come clean to Barney.
09x10,(sighs),Okay.
09x10,Unknown,"She's been missing all day, a-and I found what appears to be a-a su1c1de note on my bed."

09x10,Unknown,But mostly them getting back together.
09x10,Unknown,Why does James get it and I don't?
09x10,Unknown,"Well, think about it."
09x10,Unknown,"You have me, your dad has Cheryl..."
09x10,"""So to summarize","""I'm super dead, ""you should totally bone Loretta, ""and I never loved you, Cheryl,"" which is misspelled."
09x10,Unknown,...but James is going through a divorce.
09x10,Unknown,He just lost his family.
09x10,Unknown,"I-I know you've been dreaming of this, but... maybe he needs ""Mom and Dad"" more than you."
09x10,Unknown,"So, Billy, did you really think you could get away with it?"
09x10,Unknown,"Actually, I did."
09x10,Unknown,Ah. I was gonna give this to Barney and say I'd driven an hour away to get a replacement from an autograph dealer.
09x10,Unknown,"First, I needed an alibi."
09x10,Unknown,So I got Barney's dad a massage but signed in my name.
09x10,Unknown,Then I switched the Gretzky head shot with one of myself.
09x10,Unknown,"I always travel with 2,000 of those handsome devils in the trunk of my car."
09x10,Unknown,"I have so many questions for you, but first... you keep 2,000 head sh*ts of yourself in your trunk?"
09x10,Unknown,"No one ever wants them! They only want the ""good guy's"" autograph!"
09x10,Unknown,"In the '80s, I was the bad guy in every movie."

09x10,Unknown,"To Barney Stinson, I wasn't a bad guy."
09x10,Unknown,"To Barney Stinson, I was the best man."
09x10,Unknown,"I thought if Ted screwed up again, I'd have another shot."
09x10,Unknown,But I guess this time I really was the bad guy.
09x10,Unknown,"Hey, Ted, what's so urgent?"
09x10,Unknown,I have something to tell you.
09x10,Unknown,(sighs)
09x10,Unknown,I destroyed that Gretzky head shot and I couldn't fix it. Billy saved the day by getting a new one from an autograph dealer nearby.
09x10,Unknown,A-An hour away.
09x10,Unknown,An hour away. Just be cool.
09x10,Unknown,"Awesome. Thanks, Billy!"

09x11,Unknown,Professor?
09x11,Unknown,Call me Ted. Oh.
09x11,Unknown,I don't want to bother you.
09x11,Unknown,"Please, have a seat."
09x11,Unknown,He said.
09x11,Unknown,"I'm fairly new to teaching, and I'm looking for advice."
09x11,Unknown,"Every night I practice giving lectures, sometimes twice."
09x11,Unknown,"But when I teach magnetic force, I just see eyeballs glazing."
09x11,Unknown,"I asked around, and people say your lectures are amazing."
09x11,Unknown,"Which is really saying something, because, architecture? Yawn."
09x11,Unknown,And Ted thought...
09x11,Unknown,"Psh, yeah, 'cause physics is so interesting."
09x11,Unknown,Go on.
09x11,Unknown,"It's just that you're so skilled, and I'm a relative beginner."
09x11,Unknown,"If it isn't too much trouble, can I take you out to dinner?"
09x11,Unknown,"I'd love to get some pointers, and I shouldn't keep you late."
09x11,Unknown,What do you say?
09x11,Unknown,What do I say?

09x11,ALL,Hooray! MARSHALL:
09x11,Unknown,We cheered.
09x11,Unknown,Ted's off the bench!
09x11,Unknown,Our boy's back in the game!
09x11,Unknown,"Thank God, it's been a hundred years since Mosby scored a dame."
09x11,Unknown,The last time he saw boobies was the screen-test scene in

09x11,Unknown,"The last girl he dated, I think ""Righty"" was her name."
09x11,Unknown,Hold it. Let's not all go crazy like some wild berzerkers.
09x11,Unknown,What if this is just a business meal between co-workers?
09x11,Unknown,Ted thought back on past failed dates.
09x11,Unknown,"Oh, God, that could be true."
09x11,Unknown,How many times have I come home to find my balls are blue?
09x11,Unknown,"It all depends where Ted and his new fetching young Floridian are standing in relation to that puzzling meridian calle,[/i] dThe International Date Line."""

09x11,Unknown,"And then, as Barney made some gestures that were rather rude, Ted left to go meet Lisa, in a rather puzzled mood."
09x11,Unknown,Was this a date?
09x11,Unknown,He simply couldn't tell how he was faring.
09x11,Unknown,Then Lisa showed up.
09x11,Unknown,Ted rejoiced to see what she was wearing.
09x11,Unknown,For girls at business dinners don't have necklines that revealing!
09x11,Unknown,But then a friendly handshake gave poor Ted a sinking feeling.
09x11,Unknown,"And so, the night wore on."
09x11,Unknown,"And back and forth, the globe rotated."
09x11,Unknown,"But still, Ted's curiosity was never fully sated."
09x11,Unknown,How long could this continue?
09x11,Unknown,He was truly fortune's pawn.
09x11,Unknown,Then Lisa saw the TV.
09x11,Unknown,"Hey, the Yankees game is on!"
09x11,Unknown,Of baseball...
09x11,Unknown,Ted observed...
09x11,Unknown,...you seem to have some firsthand knowledge.
09x11,Unknown,To which the lady shrugged and said...
09x11,Unknown,I played softball in college.
09x11,Unknown,"Now the age-old softball stereotype's just that, and nothing more."
09x11,Unknown,Yeah!
09x11,Unknown,"But as the Yankees got a run, Ted feared he wouldn't score."
09x11,Unknown,"For while the date side of the line's the one we all might guess he's in, there'll be no joy in Tedville if our Lisa is a..."
09x11,Unknown,Yes! We win!
09x11,Unknown,Then Lisa took a drink and said...
09x11,Unknown,"This may sound kind of random, but there actually is a reason for my rabid Yankee fandom."
09x11,Unknown,"I guess I'll just be honest here, though crazy it may seem."
09x11,Unknown,"My first week in New York, I dated someone on the team."
09x11,Unknown,Which player?
09x11,Unknown,I'm not saying. Please?
09x11,Unknown,"What are you, a reporter?"
09x11,Unknown,Ted's mind began to race.
09x11,Unknown,The waiter came to take their order.
09x11,Unknown,As Lisa said...
09x11,Unknown,I might like the spaghetti marinara.
09x11,Unknown,Poor Ted just wondered silently...
09x11,Unknown,Mariano Rivera?
09x11,Unknown,And as she said...
09x11,Unknown,I read this place has great chicken Milano.
09x11,Unknown,Alfonso Soriano?
09x11,Unknown,I want something hearty.
09x11,Unknown,How about blackened miso cod?
09x11,Unknown,Is it Joe Girardi?
09x11,Unknown,"Holy crap, is it A-Rod?!"
09x11,Unknown,"Okay, Ted, calm down."
09x11,Unknown,You've got to get yourself together.
09x11,Unknown,"Just smile, be charming, ooze charisma, talk about the weather."
09x11,Unknown,"For this might be a date, which means there might be hanky-panky."
09x11,Unknown,"So, dude, be cool, relax, don't even..."
09x11,Unknown,Just tell me which Yankee!
09x11,Unknown,I'd rather not discuss this here.
09x11,Unknown,"But then again, I'd hate... to let a silly secret ruin such a lovely date."
09x11,Unknown,If there's
09x11,Unknown,"an elephant in the room, why don't we just remove it?"
09x11,Unknown,I dated Derek Jeter.
09x11,Unknown,Here's a picture that'll prove it.
09x11,Unknown,"As Ted looked at that cell phone pic, there were two things he reckoned."
09x11,Unknown,"This definitely was a date, but there wouldn't be a second."
09x11,Unknown,See? It worked.
09x11,Unknown,"I said some rhymes, and out my boy did conk."
09x11,Unknown,Now let's enjoy the ride.
09x11,Unknown,(brakes screech)
09x11,Unknown,"Move, jackass!"
09x11,Unknown,(honk)
09x11,Unknown,(crying)
09x11,Unknown,"Okay, I need a brand-new tale to silence Marvin's chatter."
09x11,Unknown,"I don't know, that last one had some sketchy subject matter."
09x11,Unknown,"Forgive me, but before you got here, did you smoke a joint?"
09x11,Unknown,You don't tell kids a tale that crass!
09x11,Unknown,I guess he had a point.
09x11,Unknown,"I know, I said some things that were, as you say, kind of questionable."
09x11,Unknown,"The truth is, children Marvin's age aren't really that impressionable."
09x11,Unknown,Do you remember anything from when you were this small?
09x11,Unknown,Pumpkin picking at age three is the first thing I recall.
09x11,Unknown,Hmm. Huh.
09x11,Unknown,He won't remember this. I guess it's true.
09x11,Unknown,It better be.
09x11,Unknown,Or else we'll end up paying through the nose for Marvin's therapy.
09x11,Unknown,"Okay, buddy, nice chat, but I think I need a break."
09x11,Unknown,Great idea.
09x11,Unknown,After this story!
09x11,Unknown,Robin Takes the Cake.
09x11,Unknown,"Once in an East Side bakery, your debonair Aunt Robin was making other customers think, ""Geez, who let this slob in?"""
09x11,Unknown,"She didn't care about their stares, or who was looking on."
09x11,Unknown,She'd just broke up with...
09x11,Unknown,Kevin.
09x11,Unknown,"No, Gael. Or Scooby?"
09x11,Unknown,Don?
09x11,Unknown,"Now, sometimes, when it rains it pours, and sometimes, it starts snowing, for as cream filling hit her shirt..."
09x11,MAN,"Hey, Robin, how's it going?"
09x11,Unknown,"'Twas Simon, her ex-boyfriend from her younger days in Canada, but now, he looked quite different..."
09x11,Unknown,Um...
09x11,Unknown,Rhyme.
09x11,Unknown,Uh... thinking. Uh...
09x11,Unknown,I've just been handed a news flash.
09x11,Unknown,"The word ""Canada"" is unrhymeable."
09x11,Unknown,It's easier to--
09x11,Unknown,I don't know... get drunk and try to climb a bull.
09x11,Unknown,"But Canada, damn it, ask any man on the planet and watch their stammerin' stamina as they clamor and cram it into the middle of a sentence for a shot at repentance, pass the problem on to all their non-rhyming descendants."
09x11,Unknown,I've never met anyone who could clean up after Canada.
09x11,Unknown,Except my Uncle Tony from the Bronx.
09x11,Unknown,He's a janitor.
09x11,Unknown,(applause)
09x11,Unknown,Show-off.
09x11,Unknown,Simon. Nice to see you.
09x11,Unknown,"So, what brings you to New York?"
09x11,Unknown,I live here now. What? Really?
09x11,Unknown,Yeah. That's great.
09x11,Unknown,Can I get a fork?
09x11,Unknown,"He'd always been a deadbeat and your classic hoser phony, but seeing Simon all cleaned up hit Robin like a Zamboni."
09x11,Unknown,"And as she looked him up and down, young Robin felt a tingle."
09x11,Unknown,Had Simon blossomed finally?
09x11,Unknown,"And if so, was he single?"
09x11,Unknown,So great.
09x11,Unknown,"She purred, whilst batting her eyelashes like a flooze."
09x11,Unknown,"Yup, I'm engaged to Louise Marsh, and our pad's got a Jacuzz!"
09x11,Unknown,"The bakery spinned, the floor dropped out."
09x11,Unknown,The air was thick as syrup.
09x11,Unknown,"Poor Robin swooned, she couldn't breathe, her eyes began to tear up."
09x11,Unknown,"Our wedding cake is pretty bitchin', eh?"
09x11,Unknown,And so was born the worst idea poor Robin's ever had.
09x11,Unknown,And on Ted's door there came a rapping.
09x11,Unknown,I did something bad.
09x11,Unknown,"As Robin told her tale, Ted knew she'd made a massive boo-boo."
09x11,Unknown,For stealing someone's wedding cake is terribly bad juju.
09x11,Unknown,"Robin, I'm beside myself to see what you've become!"
09x11,Unknown,You must return this cake at once!
09x11,Unknown,I can't! Why not?
09x11,Unknown,'Cause...
09x11,Unknown,Yum.
09x11,Unknown,"Ted gasped, for he had never seen a brazen act so vicious."
09x11,Unknown,"Robin felt remorse, and yet..."
09x11,Unknown,"Oh, God, this is delicious!"
09x11,Unknown,"So one piece led to two, then three, then five, then 17."
09x11,Unknown,She savaged that poor cake like some rapacious wolverine.
09x11,Unknown,"Eating, gobbling, munching, so the frenzied night wore on."
09x11,Unknown,"And by the time your mom arrived, the cake was halfway gone."
09x11,Unknown,I came as soon as I got word.
09x11,Unknown,So how bad is the damage?
09x11,Unknown,See for yourself the product of her cake-in-gullet crammage!
09x11,Unknown,Half a cake?
09x11,Unknown,What have I done?!
09x11,Unknown,The world shall not forgive it!
09x11,Unknown,This day will live in infamy.
09x11,Unknown,I never shall outlive it!
09x11,Unknown,"For I have become the girl that eats her feelings, don't mistake it."
09x11,Unknown,I think I need to get out of this chair before I break it.
09x11,Unknown,Nonsense! Hogwash! Balderdash!
09x11,Unknown,"Said Mommy, with great fervor."
09x11,Unknown,"You can't stop now, for don't you see?"
09x11,Unknown,"To the uninformed observer, you're not some sad cliché, some loser from a chick-lit story."
09x11,Unknown,"You're Robin, and you're half a wedding cake away from glory!"
09x11,Unknown,"If you quit now, then Simon wins, the tale comes to a stop at how you saw an ex, freaked out, and robbed a pastry shop."
09x11,Unknown,"If you have the guts, my dear, it's time to get empowered and be remembered for this sweet behemoth you devoured."
09x11,Unknown,"And years from now, the troubadour will raise his voice and sing of the time that Robin took the cake."
09x11,Unknown,And ate the whole... damned... thing.
09x11,Unknown,"Once more into the breach she surged, as Ted and Mommy cheered and bite by bite the towering confection disappeared."
09x11,Unknown,Some friends were called to come and watch.
09x11,Unknown,And no one had to beg.
09x11,Unknown,It soon became a party.
09x11,Unknown,Barney even got a keg.
09x11,Unknown,"Forkful after forkful, Robin guzzled French vanilla making noises not unlike those made by a gorilla."
09x11,Unknown,"Ooh, ooh, ooh! Come on, Robin, finish it."
09x11,Unknown,Mom's exhortations rang like Apollo coaching Rocky 'gainst a frosted Clubber Lang.
09x11,Unknown,"Oh,"
09x11,Unknown,"Rocky IV,"
09x11,Unknown,my favorite.
09x11,Unknown,"No, no,"
09x11,Unknown,IV
09x11,Unknown,is with the Russians.
09x11,Unknown,"No,"
09x11,Unknown,IV's
09x11,Unknown,the one where he talks weird because of his concussions.
09x11,Unknown,"I think that's all of them. Hey now, no need to be discordant. It's"
09x11,Unknown,Rocky IV.
09x11,Unknown,"No,"
09x11,Unknown,III.
09x11,Unknown,"No,"
09x11,Unknown,II.
09x11,Unknown,It's really not important.
09x11,Unknown,At last young Robin raised the final bite up to her lips the crowd grew still.
09x11,Unknown,The only sound was Barney eating chips.
09x11,Unknown,(crunch)
09x11,Unknown,Just one bite left.
09x11,Unknown,"Hey, this is like that scene from"
09x11,Unknown,Cool Hand Luke.
09x11,"You know, (Southern accent)","""My boy can eat 50 eggs "" Right?"
09x11,Unknown,She's gonna puke.
09x11,Unknown,But Robin did not puke.
09x11,Unknown,"She ate that bite and stood up, proud."
09x11,Unknown,"(wild cheering, whooping)"
09x11,Unknown,Wait. I'm not done yet.
09x11,Unknown,"She shouted, to the startled crowd."
09x11,Unknown,I've bested this here wedding cake.
09x11,Unknown,I'll gladly wear that crown.
09x11,Unknown,But now that I have done that task it's time to wash it down.
09x11,Unknown,"For it's been such an awesome night, there's just one way to cap it."
09x11,Unknown,I'm going to drink this entire keg.
09x11,Unknown,"Okay, Barney, tap it."
09x11,Unknown,Oh! Wow.
09x11,Unknown,"Hup. Ho-o, oh."
09x11,Unknown,And now that night's remembered not for Robin getting dumped
09x11,Unknown,but as the night we took her in to get her stomach pumped.
09x11,Unknown,"And look at that, the little angel's sleeping soundly, Gus."
09x11,Unknown,Looks like our problems...
09x11,Unknown,Pick a lane!
09x11,Unknown,"(honks horn, Marvin cries)"
09x11,Unknown,I hate this stupid bus.
09x11,Unknown,"Marvin, I'm afraid this night is not much of a winner."
09x11,Unknown,"Stuck in traffic, now we've missed the whole rehearsal dinner."
09x11,Unknown,I pray that I was right and that you'll have no memory of this godforsaken ride down the congested LIE.
09x11,At least we know one thing for sure,"things can't get worse, I swear."
09x11,Unknown,"Adios, truck stop burrito. Ooh!"
09x11,Unknown,Do not go in there.
09x11,Unknown,"Okay, one more story, and I'll try to tell it pretty."
09x11,Unknown,"The tale of Barney Stinson,"
09x11,Unknown,Player King of New York City.
09x11,Unknown,"Once upon a time, we all went out to get our drink on."
09x11,Unknown,When who should walk in but a girl with sweater tight and pink on.
09x11,Unknown,She ordered up a beer.
09x11,Unknown,I think you see where this is going.
09x11,Unknown,Boy-oy-oy-oing.
09x11,Unknown,"Dude, she's way out of your league."
09x11,Unknown,"She's not in Daisy Dukes, nor squeezed into a Hooters tee."
09x11,Unknown,And I don't see a Curves membership dangling from her key.
09x11,Unknown,"She has no glaring spray tan, no unicorn tattoos."
09x11,Unknown,"She's sipping Chardonnay, not pounding cherry-flavored booze."
09x11,Unknown,"Her makeup isn't running, she's not playing with her hair."
09x11,Unknown,There's very little chance she'll let you put it anywhere.
09x11,Unknown,"Your challenge is accepted, Lil."
09x11,Unknown,"There is no girl too pretty, for I am Barney Stinson, Player King of New York City."
09x11,Unknown,"You can't anoint yourself the king, just like that jerk, LeBron."
09x11,Unknown,He left the Cavs three years ago.
09x11,Unknown,"Bro, give it up, move on."
09x11,Unknown,So why am I king? Glad you asked.
09x11,Unknown,We didn't. Never do.
09x11,Unknown,It's origin story time.
09x11,Unknown,"And trust me, every word is true."
09x11,Unknown,"One morning long ago, I woke up next to a conquest."
09x11,So many great things 'bout this girl,"her boobs, her rack, her chest."
09x11,Unknown,"She had a thirst for action, and young Barney was a-quenchin' it."
09x11,Unknown,Is this important to the story?
09x11,Unknown,"No, just thought I'd mention it."
09x11,Unknown,Where the hell am I?
09x11,"The sign read 22nd Street, and my concern decreased until a cold wind blew a branch aside, revealing","""East."""
09x11,Unknown,The East Side. No.
09x11,Unknown,Wh-What have I done?
09x11,Unknown,I stammered with chagrin.
09x11,Unknown,Just then a black sedan pulled up...
09x11,Unknown,You Barney? Yeah.
09x11,Unknown,Get in.
09x11,Unknown,(sighs)
09x11,Unknown,Is any of this true?
09x11,Unknown,"Of course. Now, hang on to your ""chayers."""
09x11,Unknown,For that day I was called before...
09x11,Unknown,the High Council of Players.
09x11,Unknown,"Gentlemen, for your attendance here, our deepest thanks."
09x11,Unknown,"I'm sad to say, this council has a poacher in its ranks."
09x11,Unknown,For Barney here picked up a girl outside his territory.
09x11,Unknown,The East Side is Tuxedo Charlie's turf.
09x11,Unknown,He's mad.
09x11,Unknown,True story.
09x11,Unknown,The Agreement of 2004 quite clearly did define Fifth Avenue to be our hunting grounds' dividing line.
09x11,Unknown,Your West Side college girls are not the slip I park my boat in.
09x11,Unknown,So you should know my East Side debutantes are quite verboten.
09x11,Unknown,(sighs) Members of the council...
09x11,Unknown,Bros... nobody wants a w*r.
09x11,Unknown,Of course I've not forgotten the agreement of '04.
09x11,Unknown,What can I say? A bonehead move.
09x11,Unknown,Defend it? I'm not able.
09x11,Unknown,"But, bros, have I not been a bro to each bro at this table?"
09x11,Unknown,"My friend from Brooklyn, Pickle Jar Bob, will give some validation."
09x11,Unknown,Remember that young tourist who was looking for Penn Station?
09x11,Unknown,"She'd just come in from Boston, had a wicked good-in-bed look."
09x11,Unknown,I gave her bad directions and she ended up in Red Hook.
09x11,Unknown,"Shut up, Barney. Whoa, Bronx Donnie, let's not get excited."
09x11,Unknown,Tuxedo Charlie's not the only one here who's been slighted.
09x11,Unknown,You told her you were Jeter in your quest to lie upon her.
09x11,Unknown,Impersonating Yankees is my thing.
09x11,Unknown,Have you no honor?
09x11,Unknown,"Gentlemen, please, let's not blow this détente to smithereens."
09x11,Unknown,"Council recognizes Captain Bill, our bro from Queens."
09x11,Unknown,Thank you.
09x11,Unknown,"You all know me, and you all respect my game."
09x11,Unknown,I dress up like a pilot and meet girls in baggage claim.
09x11,Unknown,"And on my long-ass subway ride from 61st and Woodside, I came up with a plan to keep you each other's good side."
09x11,Unknown,"Barney, you have wronged these two."
09x11,Unknown,"So, for the game they're losing, you now must grant them each a West Side hottie of their choosing."
09x11,Unknown,You're kidding.
09x11,Unknown,That's the settlement?
09x11,Unknown,"Come on, that's rather silly. Gentlemen, what say you?"
09x11,Unknown,I want Robin.
09x11,Unknown,I want Lily.
09x11,Unknown,Please. Bronx Donnie?
09x11,Unknown,No chance he could get me in the sack.
09x11,Unknown,Tell that Mafioso I know something he can whack.
09x11,Unknown,"Ladies, don't you worry, your fair legs can all stay closed."
09x11,Unknown,'Cause luckily they took the counteroffer I proposed.
09x11,Unknown,"Well, gentlemen, it seems there's nothing I can say to sway you."
09x11,Unknown,"Charlie, Donnie, say no more, I gladly will repay you."
09x11,Unknown,"Carlotta, some champagne."
09x11,Unknown,Let's toast before we all adjourn.
09x11,Unknown,To boobies.
09x11,Unknown,"Oh, and B-T-dub, y'all just drank poison."
09x11,Unknown,Ha-burn.
09x11,Unknown,(gags)
09x11,Unknown,(maniacal laugh)
09x11,Unknown,"And thus, my friends, I have become, through methods somewhat gory the Player King of New York City."
09x11,Unknown,Boom.
09x11,Unknown,The end.
09x11,Unknown,True story.
09x11,Unknown,"Well, that was great."
09x11,Unknown,Your little story tickled all our ribs.
09x11,Unknown,"But one mistake you made, sir, was forgetting to call dibs."
09x11,Unknown,(gasps)
09x11,BARNEY,No! Not fair.
09x11,Unknown,But I'm the king.
09x11,And such a better dresser. TED,"Sorry, dude, but that's revenge for Lisa the professor."
09x11,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x11,Unknown,(giggles)
09x11,Unknown,Let's have another round.
09x11,Unknown,Your mommy said.
09x11,Unknown,And so we had one.
09x11,Unknown,"The night wore on, and I must say, it wasn't a half bad one."
09x11,Unknown,What memories. Our young and happy hearts were hot as fire.
09x11,Unknown,Feels like a lifetime since those days.
09x11,Unknown,(loud bump)
09x11,BUS DRIVER,"Sorry, folks, flat tire."
09x11,Unknown,(Marvin cries)
09x11,Unknown,"Oh, come on."
09x11,Unknown,Now I'm never gonna make it to Nantucket.
09x11,Unknown,(Marvin continues wailing)
09x11,Unknown,(explosions)
09x11,Unknown,"Oh, look a fireworks display."
09x11,Unknown,Some rockets red glare action.
09x11,Unknown,Thank God.
09x11,Unknown,Thought my glaucoma drops were causing a reaction.
09x11,Unknown,"Marvin, I'm so sorry this whole journey's been a bummer."
09x11,Unknown,"Soon you'll be right back in Mommy's arms, as warm as summer."
09x11,Unknown,But sadly while your troubles stop once we get to the inn the moment we arrive is when my troubles will begin.
09x11,Unknown,"Sometimes daddies screw up, sometimes mommies get upset."
09x11,Unknown,I really hope this weekend is a memory you'll forget.
09x11,Unknown,"So look up at those fireworks, enjoy the falling embers..."
09x11,Unknown,"And that, kids, is the very first thing your cousin Marvin remembers."
09x11,Unknown,"Gentlemen and ladies, it'll be an hour or so..."
09x11,Unknown,(groans) before the truck gets here to give our broken bus a tow.
09x11,Unknown,So in the meantime I suggest we all get nice and cozy.
09x11,Unknown,We're gonna be here for a while.
09x11,Unknown,"Uh, ring-around-the-rosy?"
09x11,Unknown,Yeah!
09x11,Unknown,How far do you suppose it is to the Farhampton Inn?
09x11,Unknown,I'd say about five miles away.
09x11,Unknown,"Oh, no."
09x11,Unknown,What's with the grin?
09x11,Unknown,I can walk that far.
09x12,BARNEY,"""Let's get this party started."""
09x12,Unknown,"Hey, can you push the button?"
09x12,Unknown,Do not touch that button.
09x12,Unknown,Just give it a little push. Don't push it.
09x12,Unknown,Just push it a little. Don't listen to him.
09x12,Unknown,"Half of it, halfway, halfway... Don't even touch it."
09x12,Unknown,Why can't I push the button?
09x12,Unknown,Because whenever Barney sees a button-- any button... as to push it.
09x12,Unknown,(panting)
09x12,Unknown,Sorry.
09x12,Unknown,Why are you so mad?
09x12,Unknown,Because my rehearsal dinner was supposed to start ten minutes ago.
09x12,Unknown,"But instead of stuffing my face with hors d'oeuvres that I have been dreaming about for months, I am in a laser tag security office, waiting for the police to arrest my fiancé for causing a disturbance."
09x12,Unknown,"Hey, you said ""fiancé."""
09x12,Unknown,That's a good sign.
09x12,Unknown,(sighs)
09x12,Unknown,Now what do you say we give that old button a push?
09x12,Unknown,"Take a good look at this face, Barney, okay?"
09x12,Unknown,'Cause it'll be useful for the future.
09x12,Unknown,"This is my ""pretty mad"" face."
09x12,Unknown,"Well, then, we've got a problem."
09x12,Unknown,"'Cause it looks a lot like your ""pretty hungry"" face."
09x12,Unknown,I'm missing the bacon-wrapped figs!
09x12,Unknown,Please push the button!

09x12,Unknown,Why is it so cold in here?
09x12,Unknown,You trying to get me to talk or something?
09x12,Unknown,Not really.
09x12,Unknown,"In fact, if you could just sit there quietly..."
09x12,Unknown,"Fine, I'll talk."

09x12,Unknown,Laser tag rehearsal dinner!

09x12,Unknown,Inflatable sex toy life raft.
09x12,Unknown,The breast augmentation channel.
09x12,Unknown,Single malt Scotch tape.
09x12,Unknown,The time you ran for mayor.
09x12,Unknown,"I still have 12,000 buttons that say, ""The only poll I care about is in my pants."""
09x12,Unknown,"Barney, planning a wedding is all about compromise."
09x12,Unknown,"Do you remember that one night, right after we got engaged?"
09x12,Unknown,"Where is this wedding gonna be, anyway?"
09x12,Unknown,"You know, I thought it might be nice to get married in Canada."
09x12,Unknown,"I mean, it's where I'm from, and..."
09x12,Unknown,Okay.
09x12,Unknown,"Let's have it. Get it over with, get it all out of your system."
09x12,Unknown,"I'm the groom, I'm the groom, I might as well start."
09x12,Unknown,"Canada? What, are we gonna walk down the aisle to Crash Test Dummies?"
09x12,Unknown,Play's to Marshall.
09x12,Unknown,"Canada? What are you gonna do, hire a regular dog sled or a stretch? (snorts)"
09x12,Unknown,Canada?
09x12,Unknown,Are you registered at Tim Hortons?
09x12,LILY,Canada.
09x12,Unknown,"Oh, does the organist play wearing mittens?"
09x12,MARSHALL,Canada? How are you gonna slip the ring on the bride's finger if she's wearing mittens?
09x12,Unknown,(laughs)
09x12,Unknown,Two mitten jokes in a row?
09x12,Unknown,"So... you're pretty much done, then?"
09x12,NARRATOR,Kids... we weren't even close.
09x12,Unknown,Canada.
09x12,Unknown,What do we ask on the wedding invitation?
09x12,Unknown,"""Will you be having the elk or the moose?"""
09x12,Unknown,Canada.
09x12,Unknown,"What, are you gonna walk down the aisle wearing snowshoes?!"
09x12,Unknown,(laughing)
09x12,Unknown,Canada.
09x12,Unknown,"What, is everyone gonna have access to universal healthcare so no one has to choose between going bankrupt and treating a life-threatening illness?"
09x12,Unknown,Canada?
09x12,Unknown,W-What's the band gonna play for your first dance?
09x12,Unknown,Crash Test Dummies?
09x12,Unknown,(laughing)
09x12,Unknown,"See, it's funn,[/i] ycause who gets a band?"
09x12,Unknown,Enough. It was just an idea.
09x12,Unknown,"Okay, okay."
09x12,Unknown,"Seriously, Robin, doing it here in New York would be easier, since all of our friends and a lot of our family are here."
09x12,Unknown,But... I want you to have the wedding that you want.
09x12,Unknown,So if it's Canada... just say the word.
09x12,Unknown,(stifles a laugh)
09x12,Unknown,And then say it again in French.
09x12,Unknown,(laughing)
09x12,Unknown,See? I compromised.
09x12,Unknown,Fine.
09x12,Unknown,"We'll just have a nice, tasteful rehearsal dinner."
09x12,Unknown,Maybe at a French restaurant.
09x12,Unknown,I know just the place.
09x12,Unknown,What's the name of the restaurant?
09x12,Unknown,La... ser tag.
09x12,Unknown,"You know, I was thinking about what to get you guys for a wedding gift."
09x12,Unknown,"As you know, I'm kind of the wedding gift master."
09x12,Unknown,"And, well, all this talk of the rehearsal dinner gives me a fantastic idea."
09x12,Unknown,I've been meaning to start taking piano lessons again.
09x12,Unknown,No.
09x12,Unknown,No piano time. Guys!
09x12,Unknown,Just let me perform something.
09x12,Unknown,I'll-I'll tickle the keys.
09x12,Unknown,It'll be great.
09x12,Unknown,Not even if you dressed up as Liberace.
09x12,Unknown,What if I dressed up as Liberace?
09x12,Unknown,Sold! Sold.
09x12,Unknown,And that was the end of it.
09x12,Unknown,Until my bachelor party.
09x12,Unknown,Uh-oh.
09x12,Let me guess,there was a stripper.
09x12,Unknown,You had a little fun.
09x12,Unknown,Maybe took some ill-advised pictures.
09x12,Unknown,"Next thing you know, she's blackmailing you into bankruptcy, and your medical degree's hanging on the wall of a laser tag security office!"
09x12,Unknown,No.
09x12,Unknown,"The night of my bachelor party,"
09x12,Unknown,"my friends took me to a crappy hotel, hired my ex-fiancée to be the stripper, I lost thousands of dollars, and my best friend even had his hand cut off."
09x12,Unknown,It would've been the worst night of all time
09x12,Unknown,if the whole thing hadn't been
09x12,Unknown,a prank planned by
09x12,Unknown,"my beautiful, amazing fiancée."
09x12,Unknown,"She put me through hell just to give me the best surprise of my life...which, p.s.,included an appearance by my favorite actor... non-porn category."
09x12,Unknown,"Wow, that sounds pretty cool."
09x12,Unknown,"Yeah. Except pretty not cool, because he kept talking about how he was gonna get me back, and sure enough, a few days later..."
09x12,Unknown,"Robin, there's no good way to say this."
09x12,Unknown,I've made a huge mistake.
09x12,Unknown,I can't go through with the wedding.
09x12,Unknown,What?
09x12,(choked up),I'm so sorry.
09x12,Unknown,I-I just... I had to tell you before it was too late.
09x12,Unknown,"Oh, my God, you're serious."
09x12,Unknown,Yeah.
09x12,Unknown,"And since this is my apartment, I think that you should move out."
09x12,Unknown,Fine.
09x12,Unknown,Puppies!
09x12,Unknown,"I know. Great prank, right?"
09x12,Unknown,That is awful.
09x12,Unknown,You're a frickin' weirdo.
09x12,Unknown,Such a weirdo.
09x12,Unknown,"Careful, watch the robe."
09x12,Unknown,"Anyway, for reasons only you guys and Robin but nobody normal like me would understand, she got cranky."
09x12,Unknown,And she laid down the law.
09x12,Unknown,No more surprises.
09x12,(weird voice),But you love surprises.
09x12,Unknown,Almost as much as I love lickin' myself!
09x12,Unknown,"That was me talking, not the puppy."
09x12,Unknown,"Barney, the surprises are out of hand and they have to stop."
09x12,Unknown,Deal? But...
09x12,Unknown,Deal? But...
09x12,Unknown,Deal. Butt...
09x12,Unknown,Barney...
09x12,Unknown,Fine.
09x12,Unknown,Deal.
09x12,Unknown,Man.
09x12,Unknown,"This whole ""no more surprises"" thing is so unfair."
09x12,Unknown,Who does that?
09x12,Unknown,"Barney, the ""no more surprises"" thing is the best part of being married."
09x12,Unknown,"It's true. When I wake up in the morning, I know what Lily's breath is gonna smell like."
09x12,Unknown,It's like... roses.
09x12,Unknown,"Do you really want a marriage where you have this paranoia that Robin's hiding around every corner, planning to get you back with some crazy new prank?"
09x12,Unknown,You're absolutely right.
09x12,Unknown,"Thank you, Lily."
09x12,Unknown,"No, th... that was me, over here."
09x12,Unknown,He wasn't listening.
09x12,Unknown,If you guys are saying what I think you're saying...
09x12,Unknown,Probably not. Go on.
09x12,Unknown,...then that must mean...
09x12,Unknown,"No, it doesn't."
09x12,Unknown,...that Robin is planning a surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner!
09x12,Unknown,"Dude, Robin is not planning a surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner."
09x12,Unknown,"Yes, she is."
09x12,Unknown,"No, she isn't. Yes, she is."
09x12,Unknown,"No, I'm not!"
09x12,Unknown,"Yes, she is."
09x12,ALL,"No, she isn't."
09x12,Unknown,Then why did she pretend to ridicule it as an idiotic idea?
09x12,Unknown,Because it is an idiotic idea.
09x12,Unknown,"If Robin actually was planning a surprise, don't you think she would tell her maid of honor?"
09x12,Unknown,"She didn't tell yo,[/i] ucause you can keep a secret the way my dentist keeps his car keys."
09x12,Unknown,"You don't know him, but he's lost them... like, twice."
09x12,Unknown,"Actually, just once, and... that time they were in his other pocket."
09x12,Unknown,I can't keep a secret?
09x12,Unknown,"He does have a point, Lily."
09x12,Unknown,You're kind of famous for the old blabbity-blabbity.
09x12,Unknown,Hey.
09x12,Unknown,How was lunch with Debbie?
09x12,Unknown,Great. She's pregnant!
09x12,Unknown,(gasps) Oops.
09x12,Unknown,I'm not supposed to tell anybody. Why not?
09x12,Unknown,Because she's getting a divorce.
09x12,Unknown,Damn it!
09x12,Unknown,Debbie's getting a divorce?
09x12,Unknown,"Yeah, she walked in on her husband having sex."
09x12,Unknown,"Oh! Come on, Lily."
09x12,Unknown,"Well, maybe we don't need to know every gory..."
09x12,Unknown,With a man.
09x12,Unknown,"Will you get it together, Aldrin?!"
09x12,Unknown,"You okay, Lily?"
09x12,Unknown,And that guy's the father of the baby.
09x12,Unknown,(sighs)
09x12,Unknown,I gotta go lie down.
09x12,Unknown,"Which brings us to earlier today, when Robin was setting up the decoy rehearsal dinner, complete with fake booze."
09x12,Unknown,"Trying to pass this off as Scotch, and we all know it's apple juice."
09x12,(choking),Typical apple juice burn.
09x12,Unknown,"Yes, Barney, the booze is real."
09x12,Unknown,The food is real.
09x12,Unknown,"Ooh, speaking of which, where are the bacon-wrapped figs?"
09x12,Unknown,Probably at...
09x12,Unknown,(clears throat)
09x12,Unknown,"...the laser tag place, where the real rehearsal dinner's going down."
09x12,Unknown,"Isn't that right, Theodore?"
09x12,Unknown,"Barney, there is no laser tag."
09x12,Unknown,"We're gonna have a nice dinner, some drinks, and then, according to Robin, if her Aunt Edith gets drunk enough, she'll take off her wig and they'll play hockey with it."
09x12,Unknown,Poppycock!
09x12,Unknown,"You know how she's gonna do it, and you're gonna tell me!"
09x12,Unknown,Or do I have to get my face even closer to yours?
09x12,LILY,Hey.
09x12,Unknown,How come you're not getting uncomfortably close to my face?
09x12,Unknown,"I could be in on it, too."
09x12,Unknown,(both laughing)
09x12,Unknown,"'Course you could, Lil."
09x12,Unknown,I can keep a secret.
09x12,Unknown,"Lily, don't make me laugh."
09x12,Unknown,I'd trust you with a secret as much as I'd trust Marshall with Pop Secret.
09x12,Unknown,I can keep a secret!
09x12,Unknown,I can keep a secret real good.
09x12,Unknown,"I can keep a secret like nobody's business, 'cause it is nobody's business."
09x12,Unknown,"'Cause it's a secret, and I'm keeping it!"
09x12,Unknown,Does Marshall shave his back?
09x12,Unknown,"No, I shave it for him. Damn it!"
09x12,Unknown,Ooh!
09x12,Unknown,I should call Marshall.
09x12,Unknown,I bet he's in on this.
09x12,Unknown,If he really exists.
09x12,Unknown,Okay.
09x12,Unknown,"Setting aside the fact that I've kept your whol,[/i] emoving to Chicago"" thing a secret, aren't you supposed to be dressed like Liberace right now?"
09x12,Unknown,"Okay, first of all, if I showed up in costume, it would steal from the surprise and spectacle of my grand entrance."
09x12,Unknown,"And second of all, I'm not doing that."
09x12,Unknown,Why not?
09x12,Unknown,"Because dressing like Liberace is easy, but..."
09x12,Unknown,"Uh, yes, 4/4, E-sharp... major..."
09x12,Unknown,Okay.
09x12,Unknown,"Let's make something beautiful, shall we?"
09x12,Unknown,(inhales deeply)
09x12,Unknown,I think that's enough for today.
09x12,Unknown,"Okay, I figured out how this is gonna go down."
09x12,Unknown,"We're gonna ""run out"" of ice, and Robin's gonna ask me to go get some, and lo and behold, the only place that sells ice in this whole town is right next to the local laser taggery."
09x12,Unknown,I go inside and... (gasps)
09x12,Unknown,Surprise!
09x12,Unknown,"Beautiful dinner, family and friends, free game tokens and an off-road arcade game that's rigged for unlimited turbos!"
09x12,Unknown,That is the single stupidest...
09x12,Unknown,"Guys, you aren't gonna believe this."
09x12,Unknown,The ice machine is broken.
09x12,Unknown,Is it now?
09x12,Unknown,"Well, dog my cats, what are the chances?"
09x12,Unknown,Huh? What do we do?
09x12,Unknown,"Well, I guess I could go get some ice."
09x12,Unknown,"Uh, no, they'll send someone."
09x12,Unknown,"All right, fine. Twist my arm. I'll do it."
09x12,Unknown,"But seriously, Hmm? did you get everything set up over there?"
09x12,Unknown,"Do you have enough food, have enough g*ns?"
09x12,Unknown,Did you get a vest extender for Grandma Stinson? She's...
09x12,Unknown,What are you talking about?
09x12,Unknown,"Oh, babe, you're so good at this. I love it."
09x12,Unknown,"All right, I'll see you guys over there."
09x12,Unknown,"I mean, be right back."
09x12,Unknown,"Barney, Barney, this is our rehearsal dinner, okay?"
09x12,Unknown,Do not leave the premises.
09x12,Unknown,Promise me you're not going anywhere.
09x12,Unknown,Fine.
09x12,Unknown,Say it.
09x12,Unknown,Say you promise you won't leave.
09x12,Unknown,I promise I won't leave.
09x12,Unknown,"So I left. And what do you know, the ice store is right next to a laser tag place!"
09x12,Unknown,"No, it isn't! It's six miles away in the opposite direction."
09x12,Unknown,And I told you not to go!
09x12,Unknown,"Yeah, well, you also told me didn't want a ring bear at the wedding."
09x12,Unknown,Ring bear-er!
09x12,Unknown,"We all know how great that's gonna be. The point is, I played along with her plan, and I acted ""natural"" so I wouldn't spoil the surprise."
09x12,Unknown,"Oh, my goodness!"
09x12,Unknown,Laser tag?!
09x12,Unknown,"Maybe I should go in here for a minute, just check it out for no apparent reason."
09x12,Unknown,And what's this?
09x12,Unknown,My hands-free token satchel?
09x12,Unknown,And my free lifetime refill root beer mug?
09x12,Unknown,"So for the past two months when we were letting you use our apartment to practice the piano every Sunday night, what were you doing?"
09x12,Unknown,"Oh, so that's not travelin,[/i] gcause he's the MVP?"
09x12,Unknown,Come on!
09x12,Unknown,Where's Barney? Has anyone seen him?
09x12,Unknown,"Robin, Ted's totally bailing on playing the piano for you and Barney."
09x12,Unknown,"Oh, really? Ted, you didn't have to not do that."
09x12,Unknown,But thank you.
09x12,Unknown,But he promised! A promise is a promise.
09x12,Unknown,You can't say you're gonna do something and then suddenly do something completely different!
09x12,Unknown,Why are you getting so worked up about this?
09x12,Unknown,"Because, obviously, I'm worked up for a different but somewhat similar reason."
09x12,Unknown,And someone should ask me about it!
09x12,Unknown,"I'm sorry. I don't have time for your drama right now, Lily."
09x12,Unknown,My fiancé is missing.
09x12,Unknown,Marshall got picked to be a judge.
09x12,Unknown,He took the job without even asking me.
09x12,Unknown,Italy's off!
09x12,Unknown,I have time for your drama.
09x12,Unknown,"So, Marshall can't go to Italy? Not if he wants to be a judge."
09x12,Unknown,And my Italian was getting so good.
09x12,Unknown,It was so (speaks Italian).
09x12,Unknown,"But wait, you guys already sublet the apartment."
09x12,Unknown,You're already packed.
09x12,Unknown,Marshall already borrowed and lost my Rosetta Stone.
09x12,Unknown,That selfish bastard!
09x12,Unknown,(phone rings)
09x12,Unknown,"Sorry, Lil. Hello."
09x12,Unknown,"Okay, I'm mad, too."
09x12,Unknown,I should hope so.
09x12,Unknown,"All of a sudden, his dream is more important than yours?"
09x12,Unknown,And he did it behind your back.
09x12,Unknown,Bastardo!
09x12,Unknown,He would never hurt me intentionally.
09x12,Unknown,I'll hurt him intentionally.
09x12,Unknown,Molto bastardo!
09x12,Unknown,That's sweet of you to say.
09x12,Unknown,"You could never take Marshall in a million years, but that's sweet of you to say."
09x12,Unknown,"Well, apparently, Barney went to the laser tag place looking for a surprise rehearsal dinner."
09x12,Unknown,"When he didn't find one, he threatened to dunk the snack bar guy's head into a vat of scalding nacho Whiz."
09x12,Unknown,He's being held until the police arrive I need your apple juice.
09x12,Unknown,Ha!
09x12,Unknown,And here we are.
09x12,Unknown,"Now, I believe this charade has gone on long enough."
09x12,Unknown,Can we please get to the surprise laser tag rehearsal?
09x12,Unknown,"Hey, there is no surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner!"
09x12,Unknown,"Okay, but if I may offer an opposing view."
09x12,Unknown,Of course there is!
09x12,Unknown,This place is lousy with clues.
09x12,Unknown,Is he even really a security guard?
09x12,Unknown,Because he looks an awful lot like a non-Pakistani version of the guy who delivers sandwiches at my office.
09x12,Unknown,Also...
09x12,Unknown,"""laser tag"" has the same number of letters as ""rehearsal."""
09x12,Unknown,"Laser tag has eight, rehearsal has nine."
09x12,Unknown,"And if you rearrange the letters and add some other ones, it says, ""Get ready, Barney, for the biggest surprise ever, you handsome son of a..."" and then not quite enough letters for ""b*tch,"" but good try, Robin."
09x12,Unknown,"This is crazy, Barney."
09x12,Unknown,We-We can't have a marriage like this.
09x12,Unknown,A marriage has to be built on honesty and trust and all of that Lily-and-Marshall crap.
09x12,Unknown,I though our marriage was built on honesty and trust and all that Lily-and-Marshal crap.
09x12,Unknown,I just feel so alone right now.
09x12,Unknown,"Well, you're not. I'm here."
09x12,Unknown,And I know you can keep a secret.
09x12,Unknown,"(scoffs) Yeah, right."
09x12,Unknown,Tell you what.
09x12,Unknown,How about I let you in on another secret?
09x12,Unknown,Something bigger.
09x12,Unknown,Bigger than Chicago?
09x12,Unknown,Are you kidding?
09x12,Unknown,Nope. Want to do the honors?
09x12,Unknown,"Ladies and gentlemen, there's been a slight change of plan."
09x12,Unknown,Fine! Fine.
09x12,Unknown,"You're right, Robin."
09x12,Unknown,Marriage isn't about playing crazy pranks.
09x12,Unknown,It isn't about telling long expertly crafted lies to cover those pranks...
09x12,Unknown,How'd you get out of those handcuffs?
09x12,Unknown,"...and hiring actors to play security guards and spending exorbitant amounts of money on things like giant, fake laser tag signs."
09x12,Unknown,"No, it's about honesty."
09x12,Unknown,"Size six skate, right?"
09x12,Unknown,Yeah.
09x12,Unknown,"And in that spirit, I got to be honest."
09x12,Unknown,"Every now and then, I am gonna lie to you. I just am."
09x12,Unknown,"If it's in the interest of an amazing surprise, that is."
09x12,Unknown,"You're gonna get bamboozled, hoodwinked."
09x12,Unknown,"Heck, I'll just say it."
09x12,Unknown,You're gonna get snowed.
09x12,Unknown,Why is it snowing in here?
09x12,Unknown,Put on the skates.
09x12,Unknown,We gotta go.
09x12,Unknown,Where?
09x12,Unknown,Where are we going?
09x12,Unknown,"To the rehearsal dinner, silly."
09x12,Unknown,Let's get this party started.
09x12,Unknown,What?!
09x12,ALL,Surprise!
09x12,Unknown,What-What is going on?
09x12,Unknown,I know how much you wanted to be in Canada this weekend.
09x12,Unknown,So I brought Canada to you.
09x12,Unknown,"Oh, and here's an autographed picture of Wayne Gretzky."
09x12,Unknown,Thanks.
09x12,Unknown,And this guy's not really a security guard.
09x12,Unknown,♪ Once there was this boy who
09x12,Unknown,"♪ Wore a lot of suits and said that stuff was ""legendary"" ♪"
09x12,Unknown,♪ He gave lots of high fives
09x12,Unknown,♪ And swore...
09x12,Unknown,♪ That he would never get married ♪
09x12,Unknown,♪ He really thought he meant it ♪
09x12,Unknown,Thanks for letting me in on this.
09x12,Unknown,Even if it was at the very end.
09x12,Unknown,My pleasure.
09x12,Unknown,"Oh, and by the way, there's one more secret I've been keeping."
09x12,Unknown,All those nights I was supposed to be taking piano lessons?
09x12,Unknown,I was actually taking figure skating lessons!
09x12,Unknown,"♪ Once, there was this girl who... ♪"
09x12,Unknown,"Kids, it takes more than two months to learn how to figure skate."
09x12,Unknown,I love you.
09x12,Unknown,"I love you, too."
09x12,Unknown,"I'm gonna get you back, you know? Bring it."
09x12,Unknown,♪ And swore she'd also never get married ♪
09x12,Unknown,♪ She really thought she meant it. ♪
09x12,Unknown,I can't believe you did all of this.
09x12,Unknown,"Hey, I thought you didn't like Canada."
09x12,Unknown,Are you kidding? I love Canada.
09x12,Unknown,"Holy musk ox, is that legendary Canadian doctor Frederick Banting?"
09x12,Unknown,Whoa!
09x12,Unknown,"In 1924, I discovered insulin."
09x12,Unknown,"Take that, diabetes."
09x12,Unknown,"Hey, look, it's Manitoba's native son, Norman Breakey."
09x12,Unknown,"You're welcome, world."
09x12,Unknown,"Enjoy my invention, the paint roller."
09x12,Unknown,"And of course, you know Alan Thicke."
09x12,Unknown,"Hey, hey, you... Oh, hey."
09x12,Unknown,...are the prettiest girl in the place.
09x12,Unknown,"Oh, thank you, Alan."
09x12,Unknown,"All right, all right, all right."

09x12,Unknown,Thank you.

09x13,Unknown,This is great. The whole g*ng together.
09x13,Unknown,"Well, almost the whole g*ng."
09x13,Unknown,"Yeah, there's just one beloved piece of the puzzle missing."
09x13,Unknown,That bottle of 30-year Glen McKenna scotch.
09x13,Unknown,Mmm...
09x13,Unknown,(slurping)
09x13,Unknown,"So far, that weekend had been fatal for not just one..."
09x13,Unknown,but two bottles of $600 scotch
09x13,Unknown,intended for a special wedding toast.
09x13,Unknown,"Also, where the hell is Marshall?"
09x13,Unknown,I still can't believe he took the judgeship behind my back.
09x13,Unknown,"Look, I know this is messy, my dream versus Marshall's dream."
09x13,Unknown,I won't force you guys to choose sides.
09x13,Unknown,"Good, because I totally side with Marshall."
09x13,Unknown,That would've been so awkward.
09x13,Unknown,"Hey, let's go see if they have any Glen McKenna up at the bar."
09x13,Unknown,Okay.
09x13,Unknown,"Hey, look, don't be mad."
09x13,Unknown,"Barney just thinks that if he has a judge friend, he can get all of his citations for public urination thrown out."
09x13,Unknown,How often does Barney pee in public?
09x13,Unknown,A lot.
09x13,Unknown,But don't worry.
09x13,Unknown,I'm on your side.
09x13,Unknown,Aw...
09x13,Unknown,(chuckles)

09x13,Unknown,Can you imagine having a three-way with this creep?
09x13,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x13,Unknown,"Yeah, right."
09x13,Unknown,"You, me and this guy, naked, going at it."
09x13,Unknown,Then he gets tired and it's just you and me going at it.
09x13,Unknown,"Uh, Lily... That'd be so stupid."
09x13,Unknown,So stupid...

09x13,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x13,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x13,Unknown,Help me. Who is this?
09x13,Unknown,Maybe he's one of your long-lost Canadian cousins?
09x13,Unknown,"Uh, do you happen to have all of your fingers and teeth?"
09x13,Unknown,Uh... yeah.
09x13,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x13,Unknown,Not one of my cousins.
09x13,Unknown,"Hey, thanks again for picking us up."
09x13,Unknown,It's been a crazy couple of days.
09x13,Unknown,You can't imagine what we've been through.
09x13,Unknown,"Wait, let me guess."
09x13,Unknown,"You were visiting a relative, maybe... your mother?"
09x13,Unknown,"And I'm getting a Midwest vibe, somewhere like... Wisconsin..."

09x13,Unknown,"...no, Minnesota?"
09x13,Unknown,Wow.
09x13,Unknown,"You're-you're, like, really good at this."
09x13,Unknown,You're planning an overseas trip with your wife.
09x13,Unknown,I'm seeing a... a feisty redhead who loves art.
09x13,Unknown,"She just got a job in Europe, maybe France?"
09x13,Unknown,No. Italy?

09x13,Unknown,"Total shot in the dark, but..."
09x13,Unknown,Rome?
09x13,Unknown,"Maybe I'll just, like..."
09x13,Unknown,I'll get out right here.
09x13,Unknown,(doors lock)
09x13,Unknown,You're not going anywhere.
09x13,Unknown,"No, I'm just messin' with ya."
09x13,Unknown,I rode the train with your wife.
09x13,Unknown,She told me all about you.
09x13,Unknown,You must be Marshall.
09x13,Unknown,Um...
09x13,Unknown,I was checking on the baby.
09x13,Unknown,(laughs)
09x13,(laughing),"Wait-wait a minute, wait a minute."
09x13,Unknown,So you guys both got locked out on the roof in your pajamas?
09x13,Unknown,You guys are hilarious and adorable!
09x13,Unknown,Any idea who this guy is?
09x13,Unknown,"No, but I like that he gets how hilarious and adorable we are!"
09x13,LILY,We are
09x13,Unknown,hilarious and adorable!
09x13,Unknown,(laughs)
09x13,Unknown,I'll get the next round.
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, thanks."
09x13,Unknown,"Thanks, Lil."
09x13,Unknown,"Hey, I'm sorry if I barged in on you guys."
09x13,Unknown,I can be a little overeager to connect sometimes.
09x13,Unknown,Probably because of my childhood.
09x13,Unknown,Right.
09x13,Unknown,Because of that thing that happened.
09x13,Unknown,My mother died on a hunting trip when I was very young.
09x13,Unknown,"Yeah, that's it, that's the thing."
09x13,Unknown,"Sorry, blah, too heavy!"
09x13,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x13,Unknown,"So, Robin."
09x13,Unknown,What's going on... with you?
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, nothing."
09x13,Unknown,"I mean, uh, nothing big, anyway."
09x13,Unknown,"Hey, hey, hey... this is me you're talking to."
09x13,Unknown,"Well, there is this thing with Lily..."
09x13,Unknown,"You know, Ted, if you really want to get a bottle of Glen McKenna 30-year for Barney, I got that last one at the Farhampton Liquor Store."
09x13,Unknown,The security there is a total joke!
09x13,Unknown,"No, see, I don't want to know that."
09x13,Unknown,I won't be an accomplice to grand larceny.
09x13,Unknown,I am not confirming or denying a thing.
09x13,Unknown,But there's a really high window in the storage room and if you climb up...
09x13,Unknown,"La la la la la, I'm not listening!"
09x13,Unknown,"I love Barney, but I'm not going to jail for him."
09x13,Unknown,What? Really? Why not?
09x13,Unknown,I'd go to jail for you.
09x13,Unknown,"No, you wouldn't. Yes, I would."
09x13,Unknown,Going to jail for your best friend?
09x13,Unknown,That's the dream.
09x13,Unknown,Really?
09x13,Unknown,That's the dream?
09x13,Unknown,"Yeah, it's the most noble... nay, bro-ble... thing a bro can do for a fellow bro."
09x13,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
09x13,Unknown,"So yes, Ted, that's the dream."
09x13,Unknown,"You're too liberal with the phras,[/i] eThat's the dream."""
09x13,Unknown,Name one other time I've said that!
09x13,Unknown,"A suit made of prosciutto so you can eat your way naked, ""That's the dream."""
09x13,Unknown,"A pack of lions fighting a tyrannosaurus, ""That's the dream."""
09x13,Unknown,"Being able to take a whole year's worth of dumps in one, nonstop"
09x13,Unknown,"24-hour period then not having to dump again for the rest of the year, ""That's the dream."""
09x13,Unknown,I never said Dump Day was the dream.
09x13,Unknown,I said science is this close to a pill.
09x13,Unknown,"There can only be one ""the dream""!"
09x13,Unknown,You're saying it's going to jail for a bro?
09x13,Unknown,"You're comfortable with that being the one and only dream, forever?"
09x13,Unknown,Yes.
09x13,Unknown,"Great, now you can never use that phrase again."
09x13,Unknown,"And for me, that's the dream."
09x13,Unknown,"Hey, Lily, Robin just told me about Italy!"
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, it's gonna be great."
09x13,Unknown,"Well, that is, if I can convince my husband to keep his promise and move there with me."
09x13,Unknown,"Robin, I know you told me you want Marshall to win, but I don't know."
09x13,Unknown,I gotta side with Lily on this one.
09x13,Unknown,"Later, skaters."
09x13,Unknown,Thanks again for saving us.
09x13,Unknown,"Well, I don't normally stop like that, but I just had to for the cutest hitchhiker in the world!"
09x13,Unknown,Thank you.
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, you were talking about Marvin."
09x13,Unknown,"(coos) Sorry, it's been a really, really long day."
09x13,Unknown,"When we get there, I'll buy you a drink."
09x13,Unknown,"Thank you, but, um, after I drop you off, I'm heading back to the city."
09x13,Unknown,What? I thought you said that your-your band's playing the wedding.
09x13,Unknown,Why are you leaving?
09x13,Unknown,The lead singer.
09x13,Unknown,He's the devil.
09x13,Unknown,He's a total fire-starter.
09x13,Unknown,He just ruins people's lives for his own amusement.
09x13,Unknown,"You know, he will walk up to two friends, he will find the one thing that will destroy their friendship and just-- poof!-- burn it to the ground."
09x13,Unknown,Wow.
09x13,Unknown,What's his name?
09x13,Unknown,"What's poppin', mi amigos?"
09x13,Unknown,Darren.
09x13,Unknown,You're rooting for Marshall?!
09x13,Unknown,"Well, why don't you just get a Team Marshall T-shirt?"
09x13,Unknown,What size are you?
09x13,Unknown,Extra-traitor?
09x13,Unknown,"No. No, okay..."
09x13,Unknown,What I said was...
09x13,Unknown,"See, all I meant was..."
09x13,Unknown,"God, how did we get here?"
09x13,Unknown,That's the question you're left asking yourself.
09x13,So here's how he does it,"First, he makes you feel like you are the most hilarious and adorable person in the world..."
09x13,Unknown,You guys are hilarious and adorable!
09x13,Unknown,I like that he gets how hilarious and adorable we are.
09x13,BARNEY,We are
09x13,Unknown,hilarious and adorable.
09x13,Unknown,(laughing)
09x13,Unknown,"Next, he finds some flimsy connection with you based on where you're from..."
09x13,Unknown,Cleveland? Yeah.
09x13,Unknown,Galluci's serves the best pepperoni bread! Best pepperoni bread!
09x13,Unknown,And Staten Island!
09x13,Unknown,Guys getting in fights on their front lawns!
09x13,Unknown,It's like you're from there!
09x13,Unknown,(laughing)
09x13,Unknown,This guy's awesome!
09x13,Unknown,So awesome!
09x13,TED,I'd totally go to jail for him.
09x13,Unknown,That hurts.
09x13,Unknown,"Next, he tells you a ""deep personal secret"" that is usually the tragic back-story from an animated kid's film."
09x13,Unknown,My mother died on a hunting trip.
09x13,Unknown,It's often
09x13,Unknown,Bambi.
09x13,Unknown,My father was betrayed and k*lled by a trusted advisor.
09x13,Unknown,Sometimes he'll throw a little
09x13,Unknown,Lion King
09x13,Unknown,in there.
09x13,Unknown,I have no family.
09x13,Unknown,But tonight...
09x13,Unknown,I think maybe I found two brothers.
09x13,Unknown,(sobs)
09x13,Unknown,"Sorry, blah, too heavy."
09x13,(crying),"That's okay, man."
09x13,(crying),Let me get you a drink.
09x13,Unknown,"And then, once your guard is down, the emotional prostate exam begins..."
09x13,Unknown,"So, Ted, what's going on... with you?"
09x13,Unknown,"Well... I mean, there was this thing..."
09x13,Unknown,Never mind.
09x13,Unknown,"Hey, hey, hey..."
09x13,Unknown,This is me you're talking to.
09x13,Unknown,"Look, all I meant was that there are two sides here."
09x13,Unknown,"Yes, Italy is your dream, but being a judge is Marshall's."
09x13,Unknown,"Well, that and teaching prop comedy to a tropical bird."
09x13,Unknown,Parrot Top has nothing to do with this!
09x13,Unknown,I don't need objectivity.
09x13,Unknown,"You're my best friend, I just need your support."
09x13,Unknown,I understand. You got it.
09x13,Unknown,(sighs)
09x13,Unknown,I'm sorry.
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, me, too."
09x13,Unknown,Forgot my phone.
09x13,Unknown,"I'm sorry, you guys are probably talking wedding details."
09x13,Unknown,"I mean, no maid of honor's gonna steal the spotlight with her own problem on the bride's big weekend, am I right?"
09x13,Unknown,"Keep it real, homies!"
09x13,Unknown,"You know, he is right."
09x13,Unknown,Why is this all about you?
09x13,Unknown,"I mean, you have been preoccupied with Marshall all weekend."
09x13,Unknown,I have not!
09x13,Unknown,You have been sleeping with a doll made of cushions that you named after him.
09x13,Unknown,Not true!
09x13,Unknown,"After we do our business, I make Marshpillow sleep on the couch!"
09x13,Unknown,"So there! Oh, my God, that is so ridiculous!"
09x13,Unknown,"So, what did Darren do to you?"
09x13,Unknown,"Well, a few years ago, I started this band."
09x13,Unknown,"And, you know, it was a goof... it was just me and a couple of dorks from business school."
09x13,Unknown,I'm actually embarrassed to tell you our name.
09x13,Unknown,"I had an all-lawyer funk band called The Funk, The Whole Funk, And Nothing But The Funk."
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, I now feel very safe talking about"
09x13,Unknown,my
09x13,Unknown,band--
09x13,Unknown,Super-Freak-Onomics.
09x13,Unknown,Nice.
09x13,Unknown,"(laughs) Anyway, I brought Darren in to split lead vocals, and he took over."
09x13,Unknown,"You know, first he took away my solos, then I got demoted to backup vocals, and now the only time I use a mic is after Darren's first false exit, when I say, ""Do you guys want more Darren?"""
09x13,Unknown,"And then today, I found this ad online."
09x13,Unknown,"""Ass player wanted""?"
09x13,Unknown,Move your thumb.
09x13,Unknown,"Oh,"
09x13,Unknown,"""bass"
09x13,Unknown,"player wanted."""
09x13,Unknown,"Wait, he was gonna kick you out of your own band?"
09x13,Unknown,Yeah.
09x13,Unknown,But instead...I quit.
09x13,Unknown,You quit?! That's it?
09x13,Unknown,But it's your band... you must be avenged!
09x13,(laughs),"Funny you should say that, because as I was leaving the hotel, I ran into someone."
09x13,Unknown,You need to steal this douche monkey's van.
09x13,Unknown,"Aldrin Justice, nice!"
09x13,Unknown,Your wife is cool.
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, the coolest."
09x13,Unknown,"Hey, did she, um, happen to mention the fact that I'm sort of ruining her dream of moving to Italy?"
09x13,Unknown,"Uh, yeah, that did come up."
09x13,Unknown,You need to steal this douche monkey's van.
09x13,Unknown,And then run my husband over with it.
09x13,Unknown,I think you've got a tough talk coming.
09x13,Unknown,"Yeah, well, so do you."
09x13,Unknown,"When we get to the Farhampton Inn, you're gonna go in there and you're gonna stand up to Darren."
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, come on, I Aldrin Justiced him."
09x13,Unknown,"Yeah, but I bet you're just gonna give this van right back to him."
09x13,Unknown,"I mean, were you at least gonna pee in it a little?"
09x13,Unknown,I was gonna gas it up and get it washed.
09x13,Unknown,You're too nice.
09x13,Unknown,I'm the same way.
09x13,Unknown,Sometimes you got to get in there and-and stand up for yourself.
09x13,Unknown,I always cave and side with the other person.
09x13,Unknown,I can't handle confrontation.
09x13,Unknown,"Yes, you can."
09x13,Unknown,You make some good points.
09x13,Unknown,Look.
09x13,Unknown,"I don't know you, but I can tell that you're strong."
09x13,Unknown,That's your band.
09x13,Unknown,Don't let Darren steal it away.
09x13,Unknown,(sighs)
09x13,Unknown,"No, there's no defeating the devil."
09x13,Unknown,He's someone else's problem now.
09x13,Unknown,I'm sorry if I've been distracted this weekend.
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, let's not fight anymore, okay?"
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, good, Robin, you finally told Lily you feel like she's abandoning you as a friend by going to Italy."
09x13,Unknown,Honesty is progress. Stay gold.
09x13,Unknown,I'm not...
09x13,Unknown,"Ooh, Ted."
09x13,Unknown,(indistinct chatter)
09x13,Unknown,"When you move to Chicago, you got to try Gazzola's pizza."
09x13,Unknown,"Namaste, hermanos."
09x13,Unknown,You're moving to Chicago?
09x13,Unknown,Is that even a real place?
09x13,Unknown,It's a style of pizza.
09x13,Unknown,"Ted, you can't live in a pizza."
09x13,Unknown,I got an amazing job offer there.
09x13,Unknown,"Look, Lily knows, but Marshall and Robin don't."
09x13,Unknown,So please keep it quiet.
09x13,(loudly),You're moving to Chicago?!
09x13,Unknown,He-he's moving to Chicago!
09x13,Unknown,When do you move?
09x13,Unknown,At least tell me it's not until next year or something.
09x13,Unknown,It's not until...
09x13,Unknown,Monday.
09x13,Unknown,Monday?!
09x13,Unknown,So you are just gonna disappear the day after my wedding?
09x13,Unknown,After ten years of being best friends?
09x13,Unknown,"Well, actually, Marshall's my... Don't even think about it!"
09x13,Unknown,That's fair enough.
09x13,Unknown,You are gonna give me one day's notice?
09x13,Unknown,"Well, I didn't want to upset you on your wedding weekend."
09x13,Unknown,"No, it's good."
09x13,Unknown,It'll be easy to say good-bye now that I know how much I mean to you.
09x13,Unknown,Well... (sighs)
09x13,Unknown,(door closes)
09x13,Unknown,(footsteps approach)
09x13,Unknown,Hey.
09x13,Unknown,Hey.
09x13,Unknown,"Look, I was..."
09x13,Unknown,I was never really rooting for Marshall.
09x13,Unknown,I was rooting to not lose my best friend.
09x13,Unknown,But that's selfish.
09x13,Unknown,"No matter where you go, I'm in your corner and I always will be."
09x13,Unknown,And to prove it...
09x13,Unknown,What are you gonna do with Marshpillow?
09x13,Unknown,Hold his arms back while you beat the goose down out of this bastard.
09x13,Unknown,Because that's what best friends do.
09x13,Unknown,"Thanks, it-it's not gonna help."
09x13,Unknown,Try it. One punch.
09x13,Unknown,"Ooh, that felt good."
09x13,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
09x13,Unknown,(grunting)
09x13,Unknown,"Yeah, that's it, sweetheart."
09x13,Unknown,"Head, body, head. Head, body, head."
09x13,Unknown,"Barney, wait, wait!"
09x13,Unknown,Your friendship is important to me.
09x13,Unknown,I swear on my mother's...
09x13,Unknown,"No, I swear to God."
09x13,Unknown,No... I swear to Hef.
09x13,Unknown,(gasps)
09x13,Unknown,Don't take that name in vain.
09x13,Unknown,"If someone is important to you, you tell them you're moving."
09x13,Unknown,I'm just some guy you used to know back in New York.
09x13,Unknown,Hey.
09x13,Unknown,Whoa.
09x13,Unknown,How...?
09x13,Unknown,That's a $600 bottle.
09x13,Unknown,"Ted, that's grand larceny."
09x13,Unknown,You really could go to jail for this.
09x13,Unknown,That's the dream.
09x13,Unknown,So... you're moving to Chicago.
09x13,Unknown,I'm going to Chicago.
09x13,Unknown,"Why? I know Marshall and Lily might leave, but it's only a year, and in the meantime, we'll still see each other all the time."
09x13,Unknown,"You, me, Robin..."
09x13,Unknown,Oh.
09x13,Unknown,I need a new start.
09x13,Unknown,I'm gonna miss you.
09x13,Unknown,I'm gonna miss you so much.
09x13,Unknown,"Well, here we are."
09x13,Unknown,Good luck in there.
09x13,Unknown,Thank you.
09x13,Unknown,"And don't worry, at the reception, I'll yell, ""The lead singer sucks skunk junk,"" after every song."
09x13,Unknown,(laughing)
09x13,Unknown,"I'll come up with something better than ""skunk junk."""
09x13,Unknown,"No, no."
09x13,Unknown,"""Skunk junk"" is pretty solid."
09x13,Unknown,You can't yell that at the lead singer.
09x13,Unknown,Because I don't suck skunk junk.
09x13,Unknown,"Wait, are you saying...?"
09x13,Unknown,I'm coming in. Darren and I are gonna have a chat about
09x13,Unknown,my
09x13,Unknown,band!
09x13,Unknown,(whoops)
09x13,MARVIN,Skunk junk.
09x13,Unknown,"For the record... Uh-huh. his first word was ""Mommy."""
09x13,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
09x13,Unknown,This is my band. I started it.
09x13,Unknown,"And if anyone is getting fired here, it's you, Darren."
09x13,Unknown,"So hit the bricks, s-skunk... junk."
09x13,Unknown,Is that even a little bit intimidating?
09x13,Unknown,"Nope, and the knitting's not helping."
09x13,Unknown,"I'm sorry, I just met this baby and he needs a hat."
09x13,Unknown,What... (stammers)
09x13,Unknown,You can't fire Darren.
09x13,Unknown,He gets how hilarious and adorable I am.
09x13,Unknown,Plus it is so inspiring how he overcame his mother being eaten by a barracuda.
09x13,Unknown,Gah! It's

09x13,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x13,Unknown,(grunting)
09x13,Unknown,Yup.
09x13,Unknown,"Uh, Lily?"
09x13,Unknown,Lily.
09x13,MARSHALL,Lily.
09x13,Unknown,Pause?
09x13,Unknown,Pause.
09x13,Unknown,Hi.
09x13,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x13,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
09x13,Unknown,There are real villains in this world.
09x13,Unknown,"But they don't always get real justice, do they?"
09x13,Unknown,You want to believe karma's gonna get them.
09x13,Unknown,"All right, who wants a drink?"
09x13,Unknown,I'm stealing.
09x13,Unknown,(all cheer)
09x13,Unknown,But karma doesn't always come through.
09x13,Unknown,I love how strong your marriage is.
09x13,Unknown,"And you don't need to lose weight, Louise, no matter what he told me."
09x13,Unknown,"Catch you on the flip-flop, muchachos."
09x13,Unknown,Oh!
09x13,Unknown,(groans)

09x13,Unknown,"Sorry,"

09x13,Unknown,(all laughing)
09x13,Unknown,"Hey, can I get some ice?"
09x13,Unknown,The best man just punched me in the face for no reason.
09x13,Unknown,(laughs)
09x13,Unknown,"Oh, what, that's funny to you?"
09x13,Unknown,You know what? I quit.
09x13,Unknown,You can have your stupid band back.
09x13,Unknown,I miss being in a band where people are decent to each other and there's no drama.
09x13,Unknown,I'm going back to the new g*ns N' Roses.

09x14,Unknown,"Uh, yes, Barney."
09x14,Unknown,There's something I need to tell you about the next slap that you're going to receive.
09x14,Unknown,"You see, I want this slap to be as painful as humanly possible."
09x14,BOTH,"Sure. Sure. Okay, okay."
09x14,Unknown,"Yeah, I'm gonna stop you right there."
09x14,Unknown,"Yes, you won a slap bet with me seven years ago."
09x14,Unknown,"And, yes, over the years, you got in some great slaps."
09x14,Unknown,Some great slaps.
09x14,Unknown,But here's the problem.
09x14,Unknown,You've tormented me so much that I am now immune to it.
09x14,Unknown,"Hmm. It's as if my face, my psyche, my soul were covered in that numbing cream we all put on our deals so that we can go all night."
09x14,Unknown,"Am I right, fellas?"
09x14,Unknown,"Okay, we'll all just pretend like we've never done that."
09x14,Unknown,Just like we've never sat on our left hand until it fell asleep and then used it for an away gamer.
09x14,Unknown,Okay.
09x14,Unknown,We'll all pretend like we've never done that.
09x14,Unknown,Just like we've all never taken two live jumper cables...
09x14,Unknown,Please stop.
09x14,Unknown,"Barney, I'm well-aware that you've developed a resistance to all of my old tricks, which is why I sought out special training."
09x14,Unknown,"Hi, hey, I'm sure you get this question all the time."
09x14,Unknown,But is there a special class where I just learn slapping?
09x14,Unknown,We teach kung fu here.
09x14,Unknown,"Right, see, the thing is, I don't need to learn anything about kicking."
09x14,Unknown,You know?
09x14,Unknown,"'Cause, uh..."
09x14,Unknown,"So, yeah."
09x14,Unknown,I'm good there.
09x14,Unknown,"Um, what I really need to learn is slapping."
09x14,Unknown,I need someone to teach me how to slap my friend just like really hard right in his stupid face.
09x14,Unknown,Can you teach me that?
09x14,Unknown,Kung fu is an ancient and honorable martial art.
09x14,Unknown,It must be learned with great devotion and respect.
09x14,Unknown,"So, where are we on this whole slapping thing?"
09x14,Unknown,"Yes, no, maybe...? Get out."
09x14,Unknown,Psst.
09x14,Unknown,I know what you seek.
09x14,Unknown,You seek to learn the Slap of a Thousand Exploding Suns.
09x14,Unknown,"Yes, that's totally a thing I've heard of."
09x14,Unknown,Can you teach me?
09x14,Unknown,"No, but I know who can."
09x14,Unknown,Can you take me to this great master?
09x14,Unknown,I have much gold.
09x14,Unknown,It is not one great master you seek but three.
09x14,Unknown,They will teach you the three mighty virtues of slapistry.
09x14,Unknown,Speed.
09x14,Unknown,Strength.
09x14,Unknown,And accuracy.
09x14,Unknown,"Put these three virtues together, and only then will you have mastered the Slap of a Million Exploding Suns."
09x14,Unknown,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but a second ago, wasn't it the Slap of a Thousand Exploding Suns?"
09x14,Unknown,"Pretty sure I said a million, guys? I heard a million."
09x14,Unknown,He said a million. One million.
09x14,Unknown,So I went to Shanghai...
09x14,Unknown,You didn't go to Shanghai.
09x14,Unknown,I went to Shanghai.
09x14,Unknown,When did you go to Shanghai?
09x14,Unknown,Last year I went to Shanghai.
09x14,Unknown,You didn't go to Shanghai.
09x14,Unknown,He went to Shanghai.
09x14,Unknown,He didn't go to Shanghai. Totally went to Shanghai.
09x14,Unknown,You didn't go to Shanghai.
09x14,Unknown,So I went to Shanghai.
09x14,Unknown,In search of the first master.
09x14,Unknown,Are you Red Bird?
09x14,Unknown,"Okay, enough."
09x14,Unknown,I know you're trying to freak me out.
09x14,Unknown,"But like I said, it's not working."
09x14,Unknown,So I will give you much gold to stop wasting my time.
09x14,Unknown,"Hold that thought, I just want to see if can fix this."

09x14,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x14,Unknown,(sighs)
09x14,Unknown,(gasps)
09x14,Unknown,"Relax, I'm not gonna slap you right now."
09x14,Unknown,(grunts)
09x14,Unknown,"When I slap you, it shall be beneath a willow tree next to four women and a tiger."
09x14,Unknown,"A willow tree, four women and a tiger?"
09x14,Unknown,What are you talking about?
09x14,Unknown,"Who said anything about a willow tree, four women and a tiger?"
09x14,Unknown,Guys? Nobody.
09x14,Unknown,A tiger? You were totally silent just now.
09x14,Unknown,But Marshall just said that!
09x14,Unknown,What is going on?
09x14,Unknown,How did you do that to the jukebox?
09x14,Unknown,"Wait, it's fake."
09x14,Unknown,"That's a prop jukebox, designed just to mess with me."
09x14,Unknown,"Marshall, that jukebox cost eight grand."
09x14,Unknown,I have much gold.
09x14,Unknown,"Huh, that is much."
09x14,Unknown,"You got lucky, Eriksen."
09x14,Unknown,I don't like this!
09x14,Unknown,I thought that nothing I said or did could intimidate you anymore.
09x14,Unknown,(stammers)
09x14,Unknown,That's right.
09x14,Unknown,It can't.
09x14,Unknown,(sniffs)
09x14,Unknown,(yells)
09x14,Unknown,Itch.
09x14,Unknown,Look.
09x14,Unknown,"If you're really nervous, don't think of it as a slap."
09x14,Unknown,Think of it as a high five. Okay.
09x14,Unknown,For your stupid face.
09x14,Unknown,(Barney crying)
09x14,Unknown,"So, anyway, I'm in the noodle house..."
09x14,Unknown,I'll admit.
09x14,Unknown,"I didn't expect Red Bird, Master of Speed, to be a girl."
09x14,Unknown,You sure you really know how to...?
09x14,Unknown,What is the sound of one hand slapping?
09x14,Unknown,"I'm sorry, I don't understa..."
09x14,Unknown,(slap)
09x14,Unknown,"Wait, how did you...?"
09x14,Unknown,(slap)
09x14,Unknown,"Lucky shot, I wasn't ready..."
09x14,Unknown,(slap)
09x14,Unknown,"You know, that tip isn't a full 20%..."
09x14,Unknown,(two slaps)
09x14,Unknown,"Train me, Red Bird."
09x14,Unknown,Teach me speed.
09x14,Unknown,No.
09x14,Unknown,I retired long ago.
09x14,Unknown,"Retired? You're like, 32."
09x14,Unknown,I am 86 years old.
09x14,Unknown,But slapping is now a part of my past.
09x14,Unknown,"Darn, I really wanted to slap Barney Stinson."
09x14,Unknown,This is to slap Barney Stinson?
09x14,Unknown,"Yeah, okay."
09x14,Unknown,I'll totally teach you.
09x14,Unknown,And so began my training.
09x14,Unknown,Slap this tree.
09x14,Unknown,Slap the tree?
09x14,Unknown,If you can.
09x14,Unknown,I mean...
09x14,Unknown,Seems pretty easy.
09x14,Unknown,Ooh!
09x14,Unknown,What the...?
09x14,Unknown,Ooh!
09x14,Unknown,The fabled Slapping Tree of Gongqing Forest.
09x14,Unknown,Beg your pardon.
09x14,Unknown,"The ""Fabled Slapping Tree of Gongqing Forest""? Sure."
09x14,Unknown,"Really? ""Fabled."" Mmm."
09x14,Unknown,'Cause I've never heard of it.
09x14,Unknown,I'm pretty sure everybody's heard of it.
09x14,Unknown,Guys? Yup.
09x14,Unknown,"Totally, yeah. I backpacked there in college."
09x14,Unknown,See?
09x14,Unknown,Fabled. It even inspired a popular Chinese children's book.
09x14,Unknown,It's a poignant parable
09x14,Unknown,"whose message, is if you love someone, set them free."
09x14,Unknown,But not before first slapping them right in their stupid face.
09x14,Unknown,"As my training continued, I also learned the delicate art of Chinese painting."
09x14,Unknown,That looks nothing like this bowl of fruit!
09x14,Unknown,My training went on for a year.
09x14,Unknown,A year? A year.
09x14,Unknown,One year? None of us noticed you were stuck in Shanghai for a year?
09x14,Unknown,"I wasn't being held slaptive, I chose to stay and complete my training."
09x14,Unknown,I'm not even gonna...
09x14,Unknown,"Just, whatever."
09x14,Unknown,"You have shown great slaptitude, young one."
09x14,Unknown,You are ready for your final test.
09x14,Unknown,Slap me.
09x14,Unknown,What?
09x14,Unknown,"Slap me, now!"
09x14,Unknown,"No, Red Bird, I can't."
09x14,Unknown,Slap me-- that is not a request.
09x14,Unknown,I won't!
09x14,Unknown,The Vikings will never win the Super Bo...
09x14,Unknown,(slap)
09x14,Unknown,"Wait, how did you...?"
09x14,Unknown,(slap)
09x14,Unknown,Lucky shot.
09x14,Unknown,I wasn't re...
09x14,Unknown,(slap)
09x14,Unknown,That's a big tip.
09x14,Unknown,You must have much gold.
09x14,Unknown,(two slaps)
09x14,Unknown,You are ready for your final step.
09x14,Unknown,"Awesome! Oh, man!"
09x14,Unknown,I can't wait to slap Barney Stinson right across his stupid fa...
09x14,Unknown,(slapping)
09x14,Unknown,What? What did I say?
09x14,Unknown,You must not slap anyone until your training is complete.
09x14,Unknown,The consequences could be dire.
09x14,Unknown,"First, you must meet White Flower, the second master, who will teach you strength."
09x14,Unknown,She lives atop a mountain.
09x14,Unknown,Which mountain?
09x14,Unknown,"No, not Witch Mountain."
09x14,Unknown,Slap Mountain.
09x14,Unknown,"Hate to cut in again here, but..."
09x14,Unknown,Slap Mountain? That's right.
09x14,Unknown,You're claiming there's a mountain in China in the exact shape of a hand?
09x14,Unknown,Everyone knows that.
09x14,Unknown,"Right, guys? True."
09x14,Unknown,Totally. I backpacked there in college.
09x14,Unknown,It's the largest of the Slappalachian Mountains.
09x14,Unknown,(groans)
09x14,Unknown,And at the top...
09x14,Unknown,"Excuse me? Uh, do you know where I can find White Flower?"
09x14,Unknown,How dare you speak that name?
09x14,Unknown,That is the most feared name in 40 villages!
09x14,Unknown,"Really? ""White Flower""?"
09x14,Unknown,"I'm sorry, it's just, it's not exactly Voldemort."
09x14,Unknown,Bro!
09x14,Unknown,"Why don't yo just say ""Candyman"" three times and be done with it?"
09x14,Unknown,Geez!
09x14,Unknown,(fly buzzing)
09x14,Unknown,Awesome!
09x14,Unknown,Can-can you teach me how to do that?
09x14,Unknown,"No, I retired from teaching long ago."
09x14,Unknown,"Retired? You're like, 32."
09x14,Unknown,I am 106 years old.
09x14,Unknown,What is in these noodles?
09x14,Unknown,"I'm sorry, but my slapping days are over."
09x14,Unknown,"Darn, I really wanted this next Barney Stinson slap to be special."
09x14,Unknown,This is to slap Barney Stinson? Mmm.
09x14,Unknown,"Yeah, okay, I'll totally teach you."
09x14,Unknown,The true power of any slap comes from the anger behind it.
09x14,Unknown,"So for a truly devastating slap, you must harvest the anger of many."
09x14,Unknown,"Every time someone who hates Barney slaps you in the face, the power of their anger goes from your face into your hand."
09x14,Unknown,White Flower and I made love that night in the forest.
09x14,Unknown,"No, sorry. Flag on the play."
09x14,Unknown,You banged White Flower?
09x14,Unknown,I made love to White Flower.
09x14,Unknown,And then I banged her.
09x14,Unknown,In the forest?
09x14,Unknown,"In Gongqing Forest, yes."
09x14,Unknown,Actually right near the Slapping Tree.
09x14,Unknown,Which may or may not have come into play.
09x14,Unknown,"Oh, my God, you had a tree-way?"
09x14,Unknown,"And, Lily, you were okay with Marshall having an affair?"
09x14,Unknown,What happens in the magical Gongqing Forest stays in the magical Gongqing Forest.
09x14,Unknown,Best wife ever.
09x14,Unknown,"Like I was saying, you need to harvest the anger of others into your own slap."
09x14,Unknown,"Now, dig deep."
09x14,Unknown,"Can you think of anyone, anyone at all who hates Barney Stinson?"
09x14,Unknown,(both laughing)
09x14,Unknown,"I know, I know, I almost couldn't get through it with a straight face!"
09x14,Unknown,There are just so many people who hate Barney's guts!
09x14,Unknown,Moving on.
09x14,Unknown,(sighs)
09x14,Unknown,"The point is, you need to go get slapped in the face by a bunch of gullible chicks Barney banged."
09x14,Unknown,I'm a friend of Barney Stinson. Ooh!
09x14,Unknown,I'm a friend of Barney Stins...
09x14,Unknown,I-I'm-I'm a friend of Barney Stinson. Aah!
09x14,Unknown,Ooh!
09x14,Unknown,I'm so sorry.
09x14,Unknown,I thought you said you were a friend of Barney Stinson.
09x14,Unknown,I did. Ooh!
09x14,Unknown,Oh!
09x14,Unknown,Ooh! Wow!
09x14,Unknown,Could you... also... slap me in the face?
09x14,Unknown,"God, you're just as perverted as Barney."
09x14,Unknown,Ooh!
09x14,Unknown,(groans)
09x14,Unknown,And after a while...
09x14,Unknown,Look at this thing... it's all hot and glowy!
09x14,Unknown,I'll never have cold pizza again!
09x14,Unknown,I'll never have cold pizza again.
09x14,Unknown,Silence!
09x14,Unknown,"Sorry, White Flower."
09x14,Unknown,I've just got a slappetite for destruction.
09x14,Unknown,Thanks for everything!
09x14,Unknown,I'm gonna go slap Barney Stinson right in his stupid face!
09x14,Unknown,"Wait, first you must go learn accuracy from the one who is called The Calligrapher in the far-off, mystical land of..."
09x14,Unknown,Cleveland? Cleveland.
09x14,Unknown,Why Cleveland?
09x14,Unknown,It's the city equivalent of being slapped in the face.
09x14,Unknown,Bro.
09x14,Unknown,"Man, is this place a chain or something?"
09x14,Unknown,One for dinner?
09x14,Unknown,"No, I'm here to meet her."
09x14,Unknown,Bro.
09x14,Unknown,Can you teach me accuracy?
09x14,Unknown,I can.
09x14,The proper question is,will I?
09x14,Unknown,Grammar is the first step on the thousand-mile journey to accuracy.
09x14,Unknown,"I'm, uh, assuming there's no Mrs. The Calligrapher?"
09x14,Unknown,The path I've chosen is lonesome.
09x14,Unknown,But it's no big deal.
09x14,Unknown,"I prefer being alone, I really do."
09x14,Unknown,Unless you know any single ladies you-you-you could set me up with.
09x14,Unknown,"Nope. Good, because I prefer being alone."
09x14,Unknown,"Also I'm sorry, but I retired from teaching long ago."
09x14,Unknown,"Retired? You're like, 35."
09x14,Unknown,(groans)
09x14,Unknown,I'm 34.
09x14,Unknown,"Oh, sorry."
09x14,Unknown,I use moisturizer every night.
09x14,Unknown,I thought my skin still looked vibrant.
09x14,Unknown,"It does, it does."
09x14,Unknown,"Look, uh, I'm just..."
09x14,Unknown,"I'm really just here to finish my training, um, so, the, uh, look, the truth is, I have a divorced cousin just outside of Akron."
09x14,Unknown,"Now, I wouldn't call Janice easy on the eyes... or the springs of a bathroom scale... but if you want, I could set you up."
09x14,Unknown,"Sold! Now, the most important lesson in learning accuracy..."
09x14,Unknown,(choking)
09x14,Unknown,He was dying right before my eyes.
09x14,Unknown,So I did the only thing that I could think to do.
09x14,Unknown,(stammers)
09x14,Unknown,Please!
09x14,Unknown,I slapped his back.
09x14,Unknown,"And that's when I found out wh,[/i] yNo slapping until your training is complete"" is the most important rule."
09x14,Unknown,Because my slap... was too powerful.
09x14,Unknown,I hadn't learned accuracy and so I couldn't control it.
09x14,Unknown,"And, well..."
09x14,Unknown,No!
09x14,Unknown,Stop it! Just stop!
09x14,Unknown,You did not slap the heart out of a man's body!
09x14,Unknown,If only that were true.
09x14,Unknown,You're saying that you committed a m*rder?
09x14,Unknown,I was trying to save him!
09x14,Unknown,"Shh, baby, it's okay, you didn't mean to."
09x14,Unknown,He doesn't sleep.
09x14,Unknown,You got to move on. You were only trying to help.
09x14,Unknown,You're making this whole story up.
09x14,Unknown,I wish that I were.
09x14,Unknown,"Because of the tragedy, I never got to finish my training."
09x14,Unknown,I never learned accuracy.
09x14,Unknown,"Because of that, I shall remain... forever... a mere slapprentice."
09x14,Unknown,"What does that mean, baby?"
09x14,Unknown,Here's what it meant.
09x14,Unknown,"(""O Fortuna"" playing)"
09x14,Unknown,(Barney gasps)
09x14,Unknown,(yelling)
09x14,Unknown,Damn it!
09x14,Unknown,Please! Somebody!
09x14,Unknown,Help me!
09x14,Unknown,There's a crazy guy trying to slap me and he's...
09x14,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
09x14,Unknown,Four women.
09x14,Unknown,And a willow tree.
09x14,Unknown,At least there's no tiger.
09x14,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
09x14,Unknown,Is that... half a tiger?
09x14,Unknown,You got here early.
09x14,Unknown,Aah!
09x14,Unknown,It's time.
09x14,Unknown,But you never completed your training.
09x14,Unknown,Actually...
09x14,Unknown,Listen to me. I must speak fast.
09x14,Unknown,"Once you've had your heart slapped out of your body, you've only got ten, 15 minutes to live, max."
09x14,Unknown,"Sure. The trick to accuracy is to, like, try to be really accurate."
09x14,Unknown,Okay? Don't just slap.
09x14,Unknown,"Like, like, really try to aim."
09x14,Unknown,"Look where you're slapping, that's important."
09x14,Unknown,And then try to slap that spot instead of some other spot.
09x14,Unknown,"Well, I guess that's pretty much it."
09x14,Unknown,You can slap people now.
09x14,Unknown,(groans)
09x14,Unknown,He's gone.
09x14,Unknown,One other thing.
09x14,Unknown,Cleveland has a lot to offer.
09x14,Unknown,Be sure to check out the James A. Garfield Monument.
09x14,Unknown,"Um, I mean, sure, he was only president for four months before he was assassinated, but if you get up to the top, you can see almost for 30 miles."
09x14,Unknown,As long as the steel factory's not smelting.
09x14,Unknown,(groans)
09x14,Unknown,He's gone.
09x14,Unknown,"No, like I said, ten, 15 minutes."
09x14,Unknown,"Oh, God, this is awkward."
09x14,Unknown,"Yeah, yeah."
09x14,Unknown,"It's like when you're saying good-bye to someone, and then you realize you're both heading in the same direction."
09x14,Unknown,"It's like, what do we, what do we we say good-bye again or...?"
09x14,Unknown,Right...
09x14,Unknown,(groans)
09x14,Unknown,He's gone.
09x14,Unknown,"Wait, are you just pretending so it'll be less awkward?"
09x14,Unknown,"Should I just, like, go?"
09x14,Unknown,Okay.
09x14,Unknown,My training is complete.
09x14,Unknown,I'm ready.
09x14,Unknown,"I'm ready, too."
09x14,Unknown,I love you.

09x14,Unknown,"I know, it's, like, uh, slow down, life, you know what I mean?"
09x14,Unknown,(laughter)
09x14,Unknown,"Hey, was that a fake jukebox?"
09x14,Unknown,"Yeah, yeah, fake jukebox. Nice, nice."

09x15,Unknown,"Sho-sho-shoes, baby-baby-baby..."
09x15,Unknown,"You guys can't still see where Marshall slapped me, can you?"
09x15,Unknown,"Your face looks like a ""don't walk"" signal."
09x15,Unknown,Your face looks like a photo negative of the Hamburger Helper box.
09x15,Unknown,A palm reader could tell Marshall's future by studying your face.
09x15,Unknown,"The phrase ""talk to the han,[/i] dcause the face ain't listening"" doesn't work for you because the hand is on your face."
09x15,Unknown,"A simple ""yes"" would've sufficed."
09x15,LILY,"Oh, baby, I missed you so much."
09x15,Unknown,I am so angry!
09x15,Unknown,I am gonna tear you apart tonight.
09x15,Unknown,"I am gonna tear you apart tonight! Okay, okay."
09x15,Unknown,"Look, we said that we wouldn't fight until the g*ng was all done hanging out, remember?"
09x15,Unknown,"Ever since Lily heard that Marshall had accepted an offer to be a judge, thus jeopardizing their planned year in Italy, they both knew a big fight was coming."
09x15,Unknown,But when they finally saw each other...
09x15,Unknown,Pause?
09x15,Unknown,Pause.
09x15,Unknown,"See, Lily and Marshall had a long tradition of hitting ""pause"" on their arguments."
09x15,Unknown,Sometimes they paused because they suddenly had other things to do.
09x15,Unknown,We have to stick to our budget! Okay?
09x15,Unknown,You cannot be out there buying all these Brazilian bikini waxes and Kama Sutra body oils and edible... Pause.
09x15,Unknown,"Sometimes, they paused to keep their fights from subtly changing subjects."
09x15,Unknown,"Baby, I cannot put up with your shoes being all over the house!"
09x15,Unknown,Why not? I put up with your terrible mother.
09x15,Unknown,(gasps)
09x15,Unknown,Pause! Pause.
09x15,Unknown,"And now that they were paused, Marshall realized he would do anything to stay paused for as long as he could."
09x15,Unknown,"Okay, time to go to bed."

09x15,Unknown,Depends on the prost*tute.
09x15,Unknown,"Wait, hold on, Ted What are we doing?"
09x15,Unknown,You're arguing about Robin's wealth when you really should be asking me embarrassing questions.
09x15,Unknown,He's right.
09x15,Unknown,Let's do this.
09x15,Unknown,And so we did it.
09x15,Unknown,We asked Barney all the questions we'd always wanted to.
09x15,Unknown,In one night? Four.
09x15,Unknown,In one family? Three.
09x15,Unknown,"Yes, but not while she was secretary of state."
09x15,Unknown,"Yes, but not while"
09x15,Unknown,she
09x15,Unknown,was secretary of state.
09x15,Unknown,Just once.
09x15,Unknown,With a French male model Henri.
09x15,Unknown,It was late.
09x15,Unknown,We were the last two people in the club.
09x15,Unknown,"I was lonely and I figured, why not try it?"
09x15,Unknown,That was the only time I ever split a cab.
09x15,Unknown,"Yes, but not the M.I.T. you're thinking of."
09x15,Unknown,The Magician's Institute of Teaneck.
09x15,Unknown,I've had sex in Ted's bed 14 times.
09x15,Unknown,I asked if you wear shoulder pads.
09x15,Unknown,I think I've just got one question left.
09x15,Unknown,And it's a biggie.
09x15,Unknown,Barney Stinson...
09x15,Unknown,...what do you do for a living?
09x15,Unknown,You did it.
09x15,Unknown,You banged your wife to sleep.
09x15,Unknown,Nice job...
09x15,Unknown,Still-Big Fudge.
09x15,TED,"I wuv you, Mommy."
09x15,Unknown,Unpause.
09x15,Unknown,"Kids, in all the time we knew Barney, there was one question he would always answer the same way."
09x15,Unknown,"Seriously, what is it that you do?"
09x15,Unknown,(chuckles) Please.
09x15,Unknown,"Okay, seriously."
09x15,Unknown,What do you do for a living?
09x15,Unknown,(chuckles) Please.
09x15,Unknown,Are you finally gonna tell me exactly what your job is?
09x15,Unknown,(chuckles) Please.
09x15,Unknown,"So, naturally, this was a pretty big moment for us."
09x15,Unknown,"Well, what do you do for a living?"
09x15,Unknown,Please.
09x15,Unknown,(groans)
09x15,Unknown,"God, he's not telling us."
09x15,Unknown,More booze.
09x15,Unknown,"Not so fast, princess."
09x15,Unknown,I guess subtle clues and the bar tab are two things you just don't pick up.
09x15,Unknown,Because...
09x15,Unknown,I think he is telling us.
09x15,Unknown,Tell us more about this job.
09x15,Unknown,"Well, as you know, back in my hippie days, a business man came into my coffee shop, told me money was all that mattered, and stole my girlfriend."
09x15,Unknown,That's when I decided to become awesome.
09x15,Unknown,But I had no idea how to break into the corporate world.
09x15,Unknown,"So, hoping he wouldn't recognize me, I went to the one person from whom I knew I could learn everything."
09x15,Unknown,"Do we know each other, bro?"
09x15,Unknown,We're all connected in Gaia's great tapestry of...
09x15,Unknown,(clears throat)
09x15,Unknown,No.
09x15,Unknown,We don't.
09x15,Unknown,Bro.
09x15,Unknown,"Wow, you went to M.I.T."
09x15,Unknown,Pretty impressive.
09x15,Unknown,I did get a perfect score on the A.C.T.'s.
09x15,Unknown,Advanced Card Tricks.
09x15,Unknown,"Well, look, buddy."
09x15,Unknown,You got a sweet résumé.
09x15,Unknown,But we don't have any openings you're qualified for.
09x15,Unknown,They set me up! It was a trap! It's a trap!
09x15,Unknown,We have one opening you'd be perfect for.
09x15,Unknown,Great. What do I do?
09x15,Unknown,Please.
09x15,Unknown,"""Provide Legal Exculpation And Sign Everything."""
09x15,Unknown,"Just show up every day, scribble your name on a bunch of documents, and we'll pay you"
09x15,Unknown,16 craploads a year.
09x15,Unknown,Deets are in the contract.
09x15,Unknown,I'll give you time to think about it.
09x15,Unknown,I'll take it.
09x15,Unknown,Hold on.
09x15,Unknown,Did you even read this before signing it?
09x15,Unknown,No.
09x15,Unknown,(laughs)
09x15,Unknown,You're hired.
09x15,Unknown,We'll work on that.
09x15,Unknown,Wait.
09x15,Unknown,That's your job?
09x15,Unknown,"You sign sketchy, legally binding documents that could implicate you for God knows what?"
09x15,Unknown,"Best job ever, right?"
09x15,Unknown,No more pausing.
09x15,Unknown,We're getting through this argument.
09x15,Unknown,Okay.
09x15,Unknown,No potshots at my mom.
09x15,Unknown,"Fine, no distracting me with your calves."
09x15,Unknown,Fine.
09x15,Unknown,"Look, I love you, Lilypad."
09x15,Unknown,"I love you, Marshmallow."
09x15,Unknown,(deep breath)
09x15,Unknown,Now...
09x15,Unknown,(exhales)
09x15,Unknown,...how could you take that job without telling me?!
09x15,Unknown,"Baby, I'm sorry, but they needed an answer right away."
09x15,Unknown,"This is a huge opportunity, it could be very good for our family, and we have to at least talk about it."
09x15,Unknown,"Sorry, you lost your chance to talk about it when you didn't talk about it."
09x15,Unknown,We're going to Italy.
09x15,Unknown,But I could be a judge.
09x15,Unknown,We can't give that up for what is clearly just a hobby.
09x15,Unknown,Pause.
09x15,Unknown,No pause.
09x15,Unknown,"That ""hobby"" is my dream."
09x15,Unknown,We're going to Italy.
09x15,Unknown,But it's my dream to...
09x15,Unknown,We are going to Italy!
09x15,Unknown,"Baby, can you just...?"
09x15,Unknown,We are going to Italy!
09x15,Unknown,Don't you get it?
09x15,Unknown,You went behind my back.
09x15,Unknown,You hurt me.
09x15,Unknown,You were more selfish than I have ever been to you.
09x15,Unknown,You broke up with me and moved to San Francisco.
09x15,Unknown,Barney! You're being stupid.
09x15,Unknown,The-the-the company is setting you up as their fall guy for all of their illegal activities.
09x15,Unknown,"No, you guys are being stupid."
09x15,Unknown,Especially Ted.
09x15,Unknown,What? I didn't say anything.
09x15,Unknown,"And then, kids, Barney revealed to us his master plan."
09x15,Unknown,It all went down a few months after the wedding.
09x15,Unknown,"Hey, Greg?"
09x15,Unknown,"I know you're busy, but FYI, I've been colluding with the Feds."
09x15,Unknown,They know everything.
09x15,Unknown,And they're on their way up right now to shut down this division and arrest you.
09x15,Unknown,Door closed or...?
09x15,Unknown,What?
09x15,Unknown,Why would you do that?
09x15,Unknown,"Oh, gosh, countless moral reasons... could have applied, but this is pretty much revenge for stealing my girlfriend."
09x15,Unknown,"See? That day, I vowed I would do everything in my power to track you down, gain your trust, and then destroy you."
09x15,Unknown,Who are you?
09x15,Unknown,Who am I?
09x15,Unknown,Just a guy who served you coffee once.

09x15,Unknown,"Marshall, I apologized over and over again."
09x15,Unknown,Now you're saying you never have forgiven me?
09x15,Unknown,There is nothing more important to me than our family.
09x15,Unknown,You know that.
09x15,Unknown,"Well, let me ask."

09x15,Unknown,"For a long time, deep down, I've felt sort of... broken?"
09x15,Unknown,I don't feel that way anymore.
09x15,Unknown,"Robin, along with the idea that vengeance will soon be mine, has made me 100% awesome."

09x16,Unknown,I don't even have a place to live yet.
09x16,Unknown,"Yeah, you do."
09x16,Unknown,Come live with me.
09x16,Unknown,My roommate just moved out.
09x16,Unknown,Are you sure?
09x16,Unknown,You just met me.
09x16,Unknown,I could be a serial k*ller.
09x16,Unknown,I like to believe in people.
09x16,Unknown,"Plus, what are the chances that we're both serial K*llers?"
09x16,Unknown,(laughs)
09x16,Unknown,Just promise me there won't be any naked men in the living room.
09x16,Unknown,Not a problem.
09x16,Unknown,I'm on permanent hiatus in the love department.
09x16,Unknown,Really?
09x16,Unknown,I find that hard to believe.
09x16,Unknown,I guess I'm old-fashioned.
09x16,Unknown,I believe that each of us only gets one.
09x16,Unknown,And I got mine already.
09x16,Unknown,"Well, if you ask me, you know what comes after the one?"
09x16,Unknown,The next one.
09x16,(laughing),"Oh, yeah."
09x16,Unknown,"Well, I don't really see that happening any time soon."
09x16,Unknown,Hi.
09x16,Unknown,Is this room seven?
09x16,Unknown,"And so, if you must bring food to this class, please bring enough for everyone."
09x16,Unknown,"I don't want to see someone eating, say, lobster, in the front row without sharing with the rest of of us."
09x16,Unknown,Because that... would be shellfish.
09x16,Unknown,(laughs)
09x16,Unknown,"Come on, that was funny."
09x16,Unknown,Anyway... (clears throat)
09x16,Unknown,...this is Architecture 101.
09x16,Unknown,Architecture 101?
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, no, I'm in the wrong class! I have to go!"
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, sorry."
09x16,Unknown,Um...
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, God."
09x16,Unknown,"Wait, I was in the right class."
09x16,Unknown,"First day as a professor, wrong classroom, coming through!"
09x16,Unknown,You play bass?
09x16,Unknown,"Seriously, ask my friends."
09x16,Unknown,I always say my ideal woman...
09x16,Unknown,"...does not play bass, because this is clearly your roommate's."
09x16,Unknown,She's in a band.
09x16,Unknown,"Damn, that's cool."
09x16,Unknown,This is unbelievable.
09x16,Unknown,You just picked out the only three things in here that are my roommate's.
09x16,Unknown,So does your roommate's band ever play shows or...
09x16,Unknown,Get out. All right.
09x16,Unknown,"Okay, this is crazy."
09x16,Unknown,Do you know where this umbrella came from?
09x16,Unknown,Because I could've sworn that I...
09x16,Unknown,What's wrong?
09x16,Unknown,Are you okay?
09x16,Unknown,We broke up.
09x16,Unknown,"Oh... well, I never liked him, and I never thought he deserved you, and..."
09x16,Unknown,"I am sorry, I didn't know you were dating someone."
09x16,Unknown,Who was this?
09x16,Unknown,He was the architecture professor.
09x16,Unknown,The one who taught Econ 305 by accident.
09x16,Unknown,Oh.
09x16,Unknown,That guy?
09x16,Unknown,Why did you break up?
09x16,Unknown,He's got a thing for you.
09x16,Unknown,What?
09x16,Unknown,"Yeah, what?"
09x16,Unknown,He's... what?
09x16,Unknown,"How... um, how could he have a thing for me?"
09x16,Unknown,He's never even met me.
09x16,Unknown,He didn't have to.
09x16,Unknown,"Everything he saw of yours, he went crazy for."
09x16,Unknown,You should've brought him to my room.
09x16,Unknown,"Okay? He would've run screaming once he saw my calligraphy set, my coin collection, my chain-mail corset from the Renaissance Faire."
09x16,Unknown,"Well, that's pretty cool."
09x16,Unknown,Come on.
09x16,Unknown,How could he not be in love with you?
09x16,Unknown,The way you fall asleep on the couch when you're doing the crossword.
09x16,Unknown,When did he see me fall asleep on...
09x16,Unknown,The way your hair smells.
09x16,Unknown,The way your eyes sparkle.
09x16,Unknown,I might have some stuff to figure out.
09x16,Unknown,You might. I'm so sorry!
09x16,Unknown,"No, uh, it's okay."
09x16,Unknown,It was nice.
09x16,Unknown,I haven't been kissed in a really long time.
09x16,Unknown,"Not long after that, she met a nice girl and they fell in love,"
09x16,Unknown,so it's a happy ending... for Cindy anyway.
09x16,Unknown,"I, however, am left without a roommate, so here we are."
09x16,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x16,Unknown,I have a confession.
09x16,Unknown,"Uh, I don't need a place to live."
09x16,Unknown,"I saw your ad for the roommate, and I just..."
09x16,Unknown,I-I really wanted to meet you.
09x16,Unknown,I-I'm a huge fan of your band SuperFreakonomics.
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh, really?"
09x16,Unknown,"Really, come I to all your shows, and I'm not just saying this--"
09x16,Unknown,I think you guys are the best economic-themed band in the entire city.
09x16,Unknown,Even better than Radiohedge Fund?
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, absolutely."
09x16,Unknown,I wish I had the guts to do what you do.
09x16,Unknown,"I love to sing, but..."
09x16,Unknown,You know what?
09x16,Unknown,"Next time we do a show, you have got to come up onstage with us and sing a song."
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, no, I couldn't. Mm-hmm."
09x16,Unknown,"No, I'm, I'm, I'm too shy."
09x16,Unknown,♪ But maybe just one song!
09x16,Unknown,♪ Yeah!
09x16,Unknown,"I mean, I don't like to think of SuperFreakonomics as my band."
09x16,Unknown,I think of it as my canvas upon which I paint my masterpieces.
09x16,Unknown,(laughs)
09x16,Unknown,And that right there is why I don't play bass.
09x16,Unknown,(laughter)
09x16,Unknown,Can I help you with that?
09x16,Unknown,"Uh, wow, thanks, Superman."
09x16,Unknown,No problem.
09x16,Unknown,"It's either help you or stop a train from going off a cliff, and you're much cuter."
09x16,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x16,Unknown,Can I buy you a drink?
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, no, sorry, I'm 16."
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, wow, sorry."
09x16,Unknown,Have a good night.
09x16,Unknown,"Wait, you believe that?"
09x16,Unknown,I like you.
09x16,Unknown,"Uh, sure, you can buy me a drink."
09x16,Unknown,MacLaren's.
09x16,Unknown,"The last time I was here, I thought this place was called Puzzles."
09x16,Unknown,That's an odd name.
09x16,Unknown,Why would you call a bar Puzzles?
09x16,Unknown,Unless that's the puzzle.
09x16,Unknown,"Well, um, thank you for the drink."
09x16,Unknown,"Uh, so, do you want to get dinner sometime?"
09x16,Unknown,Um...
09x16,Unknown,"Louis, you're really nice, but..."
09x16,Unknown,"I was in love with somebody a long time ago, and he died."
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry."
09x16,Unknown,"Uh, it's silly, but... it's like the first lottery ticket I ever bought was... kaboom, jackpot, and I'm pretty sure I'm not going to win again, not like that anyway, so I don't generally buy lottery tickets anymore."
09x16,Unknown,I understand.
09x16,Unknown,So I should... go.
09x16,Unknown,"Well, if you change your mind..."
09x16,Unknown,...give me a call.
09x16,Unknown,Okay.
09x16,Unknown,"Okay,"
09x16,Unknown,now
09x16,Unknown,we're even!
09x16,Unknown,What?! What?!
09x16,Unknown,So we got dinner. And?
09x16,Unknown,He's... nice.
09x16,Unknown,Nice? He sounds amazing!
09x16,Unknown,"Handsome, good dresser, paid for dinner."
09x16,Unknown,What more do you want?
09x16,Unknown,Do you know how rough it is out there?
09x16,Unknown,I once met a guy claiming to be a genie whose penis grants wishes.
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, my God, who would even fall for that?"
09x16,Unknown,"The point is, Louis sounds great."
09x16,Unknown,And that's how your mom started dating Louis.
09x16,Unknown,"And for a couple years, it was fun."

09x16,Unknown,It just wasn't love.
09x16,Unknown,But then fate intervened.
09x16,Unknown,"Anyway, you guys wouldn't, uh, happen to know of any good wedding bands available at the last minute, would you?"
09x16,Unknown,"Hi. One ticket to Farhampton, please."
09x16,Unknown,"Now, Louis had a beach house out in Farhampton, so he let your mother stay there."
09x16,Unknown,"The day before the wedding, as she was taking some cookies out of the oven, she got an e-mail."
09x16,Unknown,(gasps)
09x16,Unknown,What the damn hell?!
09x16,Unknown,"""Bass player wanted,"" that is what the ad said."
09x16,Unknown,Can you believe that?
09x16,Unknown,After I'm the one who invited Darren into the band.
09x16,Unknown,What am I gonna do?
09x16,Unknown,You need to steal this douche monkey's van.
09x16,Unknown,Then run my husband over with it.
09x16,Unknown,"Well, that's very tempting."
09x16,Unknown,I've never really been the type of person to...
09x16,Unknown,"""Must be hotter than the girl we have now, who, in my opinion, is a six at best""?"
09x16,Unknown,"Aw, geez, what is this knucklehead doing?"
09x16,Unknown,Excuse me! Hey!
09x16,Unknown,You guys need a lift?
09x16,Unknown,The best man just punched me in the face for no reason.
09x16,Unknown,You know what? I quit.
09x16,Unknown,You can have your stupid band back.
09x16,Unknown,"Linus, whoever that best man is, I would like to buy him a double of your finest scotch."
09x16,Unknown,Louis!
09x16,Unknown,Will you marry me?
09x16,Unknown,Can you give me a minute? Um... okay.
09x16,Unknown,There's someone that I need to talk to.
09x16,Unknown,I'll-I'll be right back.
09x16,Unknown,(breathes heavily)
09x16,Unknown,"Hi, Max. It's me."
09x16,Unknown,Sorry to interrupt.
09x16,Unknown,I know you're probably up there playing baseball with your dad.
09x16,Unknown,"Um, look, I-I've got a situation here."
09x16,Unknown,I think that I have been holding myself back from falling in love again.
09x16,(voice breaks),And I think it's because I can't let you go.
09x16,But you're not here anymore... so I have to ask this,Would it be okay if I moved on?
09x16,Unknown,"I realize that you have no way of answering that, but, um..."
09x16,Unknown,"Oh, okay... (laughs)"
09x16,Unknown,I will take that as yes.
09x16,Unknown,"Um, in that case, I should get back in there."
09x16,(voice breaks),I guess this is it.
09x16,Unknown,For real this time.
09x16,Unknown,"Bye, Max. (sniffles)"
09x16,Unknown,"(sighs, sniffles)"
09x16,Unknown,So?
09x16,Unknown,My answer is... no.
09x16,Unknown,(sighs)
09x16,Unknown,(sobs)
09x16,Unknown,You're in luck.
09x16,Unknown,Mother of the bride never checked in.
09x16,Unknown,How many keys will you be needing?
09x16,Unknown,Just one.
09x16,Unknown,Yeah. I just...
09x16,Unknown,I broke up with someone.
09x16,Unknown,I think room number six is the room for you.

09x16,Unknown,"Every night when she tucked you in, for instance."
09x16,Unknown,"But that performance, that first night I ever heard her sing, that one will always be my favorite."
09x16,Unknown,Wow.
09x16,Unknown,"Barney, I was just out there on the patio... and there's someone in the room next to us."
09x16,Unknown,"I didn't see her, but..."
09x16,Unknown,"Well, she was playing the ukulele..."
09x16,Unknown,Barney?
09x17,Unknown,"Well, that party was a dud."
09x17,Unknown,"I think I struck out with, like, 20 girls."
09x17,Unknown,And... my condom expired.
09x17,Unknown,We are losers!
09x17,Unknown,We've tried everything.

09x17,Unknown,"Original Air Date on February 3, 2014"
09x17,Unknown,"Kids, for a brief period when I was seven, my best friend was a balloon."
09x17,It was the classic story,"boy meets balloon, boy and balloon become friends, boy loses balloon when Mom sets out hot dogs in the backyard."
09x17,Unknown,No!
09x17,Unknown,"Decades later, boy's new best friend finds out about the whole thing and never lets him live it down."
09x17,Unknown,I hate you so much.
09x17,Unknown,The whole thing taught me a lesson.
09x17,Unknown,"If you love something, you can never let it go, not even for a second, or it's gone forever."
09x17,Unknown,"Well, at least I still got my hot dogs."
09x17,Unknown,No!
09x17,Unknown,It was a lesson that took me nearly 30 years to unlearn.
09x17,Unknown,Where could Barney be?
09x17,Unknown,"Oh, relax. He always finds his way home."
09x17,Unknown,"St. Patrick's Day, 2008."
09x17,Unknown,He did not find his way home that night.
09x17,Unknown,That Dumpster was a block from his apartment.
09x17,Unknown,I call that a win.

09x17,Unknown,"Also, that isn't the filthiest trash he's ever slept with."
09x17,Unknown,"Ho! My future husband, folks!"
09x17,Unknown,(both laughing)
09x17,Unknown,Or maybe he bailed on the wedding.
09x17,Unknown,"Oh, come on."
09x17,Unknown,Don't even think like that.
09x17,Unknown,"Well, he's terrified of commitment... although, ironically, loves being tied down..."
09x17,Unknown,"Look, as the run-offee at my own almost-wedding, I can tell you you are fine."
09x17,Unknown,Barney is no Stella. Mmm.
09x17,Unknown,"Hey, have you talked to her in a while?"
09x17,Unknown,Stella? Yeah.
09x17,Unknown,The woman who broke my heart and embarrassed me in front of all my friends and loved ones?
09x17,(laughing),Uh... no.
09x17,Unknown,That was a lie.
09x17,Unknown,"A few days earlier, I had talked to Stella on the phone."
09x17,Unknown,"Because, as you may recall, I'm kind of the wedding gift master."
09x17,Unknown,"Okay, I'm gonna stop you."
09x17,Unknown,Do you not hear how weird this all sounds?
09x17,Unknown,What part of this is weird?
09x17,Unknown,You're going to your ex-girlfriend's wedding.
09x17,Unknown,It's not weird at all. Where you'll be the best man...
09x17,Unknown,Utterly not weird.
09x17,Unknown,"And now, less than a week before the wedding, you're calling the woman who left you at the altar and moved three time zones away on the razor-thin chance that I somehow ended up with her grandmother's locket?"
09x17,Unknown,"You know what's weird, Stella?"
09x17,Unknown,Not seeing
09x17,Unknown,Star Wars
09x17,Unknown,until you're 30.
09x17,Unknown,You're trying to blow up the wedding.
09x17,Unknown,"You called C-3PO ""the Tin Man."""
09x17,Unknown,He is made of tin!
09x17,Unknown,It's Tatooine scrap metal!
09x17,Unknown,This is not an argument you are gonna win.
09x17,Unknown,"Now, do you have the locket or not?"
09x17,Unknown,"Look, I might have it somewhere in one of my old boxes in our storage locker, but even if I did, I cannot get out there this week."
09x17,Unknown,I'm totally swamped.
09x17,Unknown,"One ticket to Los Angeles, please."
09x17,Unknown,So the reason someone can't come up
09x17,Unknown,"to fix the air conditioning is that the ghost of Captain Dearduff, who haunts this room, likes it muggy?"
09x17,Unknown,That's correct.
09x17,Unknown,"Although, now that I say it out loud, it does sound kind of ridiculous, because there's no such thing as ghosts."
09x17,Unknown,Right?
09x17,Unknown,"You have outflanked me, Front Desk Guy!"
09x17,Unknown,Victory is yours!
09x17,Unknown,"The truth is, there was a ghost in that room."
09x17,Unknown,"You see, minutes earlier, Marshall had been in the middle of the worst fight of his marriage, when all of sudden, Lily stormed out."
09x17,Unknown,"Damn it, Lily."
09x17,Unknown,This is so unfair.
09x17,Unknown,I know!
09x17,Unknown,Storming out in the middle of an argument?
09x17,Unknown,So childish!
09x17,Unknown,"Thank you, Ghost Lily."
09x17,Unknown,I'm glad at least you see it that way.
09x17,Unknown,"Although, let's be honest, I did you a favor."
09x17,Unknown,You were gonna lose.
09x17,Unknown,I... what?
09x17,Unknown,I was gonna lose?
09x17,Unknown,"Uh, check your spectral scorecard, Ghost Lily."
09x17,Unknown,I had you on the ropes.
09x17,Unknown,That's why you ran out.
09x17,Unknown,I ran out because you brought up San Francisco.
09x17,Unknown,It was a valid point.
09x17,Unknown,It's ancient history.
09x17,Unknown,"If you're mad at anyone, you're mad at 2006 Lily."
09x17,Unknown,"Well, I can't very well have an argument with 2006..."
09x17,(à la Borat),Is nice!
09x17,(normal voice),Do people still say that?
09x17,Unknown,"I'm sorry, how exactly are you gonna teach us how to live?"
09x17,Unknown,The journey to awesome starts with a single...
09x17,Unknown,"Actually, lots of singles."
09x17,Unknown,We're going to a strip club.
09x17,Unknown,(laughs)
09x17,Unknown,Strip club?
09x17,Unknown,We're in the middle of nowhere.
09x17,Unknown,There is always a strip club.
09x17,Unknown,"Hey, are you a little worried this guy might k*ll us?"
09x17,Unknown,We just put a down payment on adult bunk beds.
09x17,Unknown,Would getting k*lled really be so bad?
09x17,Unknown,Good point. I got a weird feeling.
09x17,Unknown,"I mean, there's something off about..."
09x17,Unknown,Whoa!
09x17,BARNEY,"Question: why does this sign say ""gentlemen's club""?"
09x17,Answer,because The Crab Shed is a place for gentlemen.
09x17,Unknown,A gentleman tips generously.
09x17,Unknown,A gentleman uses the complimentary bathroom cologne...
09x17,(whispering),...but not too much.
09x17,Unknown,Oh. This is important.
09x17,Unknown,Your instinct may be to avoid the free buffet.
09x17,Unknown,Your instinct is wrong.
09x17,Unknown,"Don't sleep on the meatballs, gentlemen."
09x17,Unknown,They are exquisite!
09x17,Unknown,Come on!
09x17,Unknown,"You know, I liked Stella."
09x17,Unknown,"Even though she broke your heart, I'd still put her in your top five."
09x17,Unknown,Which are...?
09x17,Unknown,"All right, number five, Stella. Mm-hmm."
09x17,Unknown,"Number four, Zoey."
09x17,Unknown,"Number three, uh, the Slutty Pumpkin."
09x17,Unknown,Ah.
09x17,Unknown,"Number two, Marshall, that time you guys pretended to be a couple when Barney was trying to sell the apartment."
09x17,Unknown,(both laugh)
09x17,Unknown,"And number one, Victoria."
09x17,Unknown,"Well, you've given this some thought."
09x17,Unknown,"Well, we all have."
09x17,Unknown,There's kind of a running e-mail chain about it.
09x17,Unknown,But the pastry chef was the best.
09x17,Unknown,No question.
09x17,Unknown,I do miss her sticky buns.
09x17,Unknown,"Uh, euphemism?"
09x17,Unknown,Nope.
09x17,Unknown,(laughs)
09x17,Unknown,Can I be honest?
09x17,Unknown,"Um, it was kind of crazy how all of sudden it was just... over between you and Victoria."
09x17,Unknown,I mean... you guys were seven years in the making.
09x17,Unknown,She left her fiancé for you.
09x17,Unknown,What... why would you break up?
09x17,Unknown,What happened?
09x17,Unknown,(clears throat)
09x17,Unknown,"We, um... we broke up because of you."
09x17,Unknown,"Oh, my God, this is amazing!"
09x17,Unknown,"I ruined my pants, but it's totally worth it!"
09x17,Unknown,Best meatballs ever!
09x17,Unknown,Mmm! I'm gonna ask a serious question right now.
09x17,Unknown,Can a person live in a strip club?
09x17,Unknown,Yes.
09x17,Unknown,"For the next few years, your strip club will be like home."
09x17,Unknown,"Then, one day, you'll date a stripper and almost marry her, and after that, you'll realize you're done with strip clubs."
09x17,Unknown,"In the sense that you'll dial it back to, like, once a week."
09x17,Unknown,I feel like I can talk to women now. Yeah.
09x17,Unknown,"You just stick a dollar bill in your mouth, and the conversation starts itself."
09x17,Unknown,"You know, I think we're ready to go back to that party and meet some ladies."
09x17,Unknown,(laughs)
09x17,Unknown,Yeah!
09x17,Unknown,Yeah! Yeah!
09x17,Unknown,You! Are! Not! Ready!
09x17,Unknown,Your training is complete when I say your training is complete!
09x17,Unknown,"Come on, let's go."
09x17,Unknown,You-you broke up with Victoria because of me?
09x17,Unknown,"She didn't want us to be friends anymore, so I had to let her go."
09x17,Unknown,Ted...
09x17,Unknown,I just...
09x17,Unknown,"Wow, I..."
09x17,Unknown,And-and you haven't talked to her since?
09x17,Unknown,Haven't talked to her since.
09x17,Unknown,Also a lie.
09x17,Unknown,Unbelievable.
09x17,Unknown,And I assume this is all in the hopes that Robin'll ditch her own wedding and run off with you?
09x17,Unknown,What? No.
09x17,Unknown,I would never.
09x17,Unknown,You would never run off with a girl on the day of her wedding?
09x17,Unknown,Ri...
09x17,Unknown,"Okay, that's a fair point."
09x17,Unknown,I'm not done.
09x17,Unknown,...ight.
09x17,Unknown,"So, do you have it?"
09x17,Unknown,I'm looking at it right now.
09x17,Unknown,"What? Oh, uh... stay there."
09x17,Unknown,I'm-I'm on my way.
09x17,Unknown,I'm in Germany.
09x17,Unknown,Danke schon!
09x17,Unknown,I see.
09x17,Unknown,"Look, if it means that much to you, as soon as I'm done here at the bakery, I'll overnight it."
09x17,Unknown,It'll be there in 24 hours.
09x17,Unknown,(exhales)
09x17,Unknown,Thank you.
09x17,Unknown,"So this bakery, what kind of, uh..."
09x17,Unknown,You want me to send you some chocolate truffle streuselkuchen?
09x17,Unknown,"Yes, please, you're the best, thank you."
09x17,Unknown,"But then, 24 hours later... disaster."
09x17,MAN,"I'm sorry, Mr. Mosby."
09x17,Unknown,It says here your package was delivered earlier today.
09x17,Unknown,Your wife signed for it.
09x17,Unknown,My... what?
09x17,Unknown,I... I don't have a wife.
09x17,Unknown,"So, then, who's Jeanette Mosby?"
09x17,Unknown,"Oh, you're kidding me."
09x17,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh, 2013 me!"
09x17,Unknown,So many questions!
09x17,Unknown,How many MySpace friends do I have now?
09x17,Unknown,Has James Blunt put out the steady stream of number one hits we all expect from him?
09x17,Unknown,And why are we in this hotel room?
09x17,Unknown,We're here for Barney's wedding.
09x17,Unknown,Barney's
09x17,Unknown,wedding?
09x17,Unknown,"Oh, God."
09x17,Unknown,What desperate ho-bag is handcuffing herself to that time b*mb?
09x17,Unknown,My dad did a real number on me.
09x17,Unknown,"Okay, uh... Ghost Lily, seven-years-ago Ghost Lily, can we get on with this so I can win the argument and we can move on to my regularly scheduled fantasy of you two making out with each other?"
09x17,Unknown,"Sure. Just so you know, I really like it when..."
09x17,Unknown,I know. I'm you.
09x17,Unknown,And I don't like that anymore.
09x17,MARSHALL,"Okay, yes, seven-years-ago Lily, maybe I am wrong for still being mad at you about San Francisco and our breakup."
09x17,Unknown,"But the truth is, when you left me, that was the saddest I've ever been in my life."
09x17,Unknown,Really?
09x17,Unknown,The saddest you've ever been in your life?
09x17,Unknown,Saddest I've ever been in my life.
09x17,Unknown,"I mean, I am sitting right here."
09x17,Unknown,"Look, Dad, yes, obviously, losing you was way worse, but I'm trying to make a bigger point here."
09x17,Unknown,And what point is that?
09x17,Unknown,"Because she hurt you once, you now get to hurt her?"
09x17,Unknown,It's not how it works in a marriage.
09x17,ALL,Ooh...
09x17,Unknown,You're totally gonna lose.
09x17,Unknown,I can't believe you're open at this hour.
09x17,Unknown,I'm always open for my friends.
09x17,Unknown,What are we doing here?
09x17,Unknown,We should go back to the party.
09x17,Unknown,In relaxed-fit domestic denim?
09x17,Unknown,"I'm sorry, is this a costume party, and you're going as 1994?"
09x17,Unknown,"Would you be a peach and bump this, please?"
09x17,Unknown,Who cares about any of this?
09x17,Unknown,They're just clothes.
09x17,Unknown,"Just clothes? Ted... sorry, force of habit... boys, suits are cool."
09x17,Unknown,Exhibit A.
09x17,Unknown,I don't care how well-dressed I am.
09x17,Unknown,The real challenge is walking up to a girl that I've never met before and somehow talking to her with words from my mouth.
09x17,Unknown,I've looked at it from every possible angle.
09x17,Unknown,There's just no way to do it.
09x17,Unknown,(both chuckle)
09x17,Unknown,What's your name?
09x17,Unknown,Justin.
09x17,Unknown,Have you met Justin?
09x17,Unknown,"Uh, no. Hi, I'm Julie."
09x17,Unknown,"So simple, so elegant."
09x17,Unknown,Hmm. That's it?
09x17,Unknown,You just walk up to someone you don't know and introduce them to your buddy?
09x17,Unknown,I don't know. That sounds kind of...
09x17,Unknown,Have you met Kyle?
09x17,Unknown,"Hi, Kyle."
09x17,Unknown,Are you Jesus?!
09x17,Unknown,"I would have understood, you know?"
09x17,Unknown,"I mean, if you told me that we couldn't be friends anymore, I-I wouldn't have liked it, but I, God, I would have understood."
09x17,Unknown,I could never do that.
09x17,Unknown,Why not?
09x17,Unknown,"Ted, okay, I insist that you tell me why not."
09x17,Unknown,No way.
09x17,Unknown,Answer the question. It's... it's for the bride.
09x17,Unknown,"I'm not gonna answer the question, because you know the answer."
09x17,Unknown,You want to talk about my top five?
09x17,Unknown,"There's no top five, Robin!"
09x17,Unknown,"There's just a top one, and it's you."
09x17,Unknown,And the only reason I'm saying any of this is 'cause I know that it's not gonna change anything.
09x17,Unknown,You and Barney are getting married today.
09x17,Unknown,"If I have to hold the shotgun myself, it's happening."
09x17,Unknown,I thought you don't like g*ns.
09x17,Unknown,I'm the best man.
09x17,Unknown,I swore on the Bro Code.
09x17,Unknown,I don't want to go to Bro Hell.
09x17,Unknown,Bro Hell sounds bad.
09x17,Unknown,I'm sure Barney's got a whole thing about Bro Hell.
09x17,Unknown,But what about when we get back from our honeymoon?
09x17,Unknown,What about our first night out at the bar?
09x17,Unknown,But what then?
09x17,Unknown,"I mean, is it gonna be weird?"
09x17,Unknown,No.
09x17,Unknown,How can you be so sure?
09x17,Unknown,Because I'm not gonna be there.
09x17,Unknown,I'm moving to Chicago.
09x17,Unknown,You're moving to Chicago? That's right.
09x17,Unknown,I'm gonna work for Hammond Druthers.
09x17,Unknown,The penis-building guy?
09x17,Unknown,They're not all penis buildings.
09x17,Unknown,They just designed this clamshell amphitheater for the St. Louis Symphony.
09x17,Unknown,"That one, it doesn't look like a penis, anyway."
09x17,Unknown,I can't believe you're leaving New York.
09x17,Unknown,"Wait, is this be... is this because of me?"
09x17,Unknown,"No, it's not because of you."
09x17,Unknown,"Well, maybe at first it was, but..."
09x17,Unknown,(sighs)
09x17,Unknown,(grunts)
09x17,Unknown,It's been a really long week.
09x17,Unknown,"Some stuff has happened and... it's just made me feel like it's, it's time to move on."
09x17,Unknown,"Yes, good things happened to me in New York, but bad things happened, too."
09x17,Unknown,Like your top five worst relationships?
09x17,Unknown,"Okay, come on. Let me hear it."
09x17,Unknown,"Number five, Blah Blah. Mm-hmm."
09x17,Unknown,"Number four, boats, boats, boats."
09x17,Unknown,"Number three, Karen. Mm."
09x17,Unknown,"Number two, uh, Zoey. She made both lists."
09x17,Unknown,"Number one, by a landslide, Jeanette."
09x17,Unknown,"Jeanette, of course. By the way, have you talked to Jeanette lately?"
09x17,Unknown,I haven't talked to her.
09x17,Unknown,Liar.
09x17,Unknown,"So I was at your apartment stealing your mail, and apparently there's some chick named Victoria sending you jewelry from Germany?"
09x17,Unknown,Somebody owes somebody an explanation.
09x17,Unknown,"Jeanette, that locket is a wedding gift for Robin."
09x17,Unknown,"Robin?! Oh, God, this again?"
09x17,Unknown,That I'm giving to her as a friend because I'm kind of the wedding gift master!
09x17,Unknown,Now bring it back to me right now!
09x17,Unknown,Fine. Meet me at the Bow Bridge in Central Park in one hour.
09x17,Unknown,"And by the way, I want Kenny back."
09x17,Unknown,Who's Kenny?!
09x17,Unknown,My pet tarantula.
09x17,Unknown,(gasps)
09x17,Unknown,"By the way, I love your hair."
09x17,Unknown,I love

09x17,Unknown,"Imaginary women, right?"
09x17,Unknown,"I need everyone to just be quiet, please."
09x17,Unknown,"Look, I know that I could have handled all of this better."
09x17,Unknown,"But setting aside the fact that all of our friends are here and that we don't speak Italian, if we stay in New York, we both get to follow our dreams."
09x17,Unknown,Are we really gonna go someplace where only one of us gets to do that?
09x17,Unknown,"Of course not. Well, then how can you...?"
09x17,Unknown,Wait-- what?
09x17,Unknown,We're not moving to Italy.
09x17,Unknown,We have a baby. It makes sense to stay here.
09x17,Unknown,Even I know that.
09x17,Unknown,You do?
09x17,Unknown,So... I win?
09x17,Unknown,"Well, then, ho, hey, ho."
09x17,Unknown,"In your ethereal face, Ghost Lily."
09x17,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, the Convincer right here!"
09x17,Unknown,She thought I was gonna lose.
09x17,Unknown,You
09x17,Unknown,are
09x17,Unknown,gonna lose.
09x17,Unknown,You're gonna lose this.
09x17,Unknown,"If you keep lying to me, if you keep cutting me out of decisions, if you keep using words like ""winning"" and ""losing"" when you talk about our marriage."
09x17,Unknown,"It's not like it'll happen all at once, but if you keep acting this way, little by little, you're gonna lose me."
09x17,Unknown,Is that what you want?
09x17,Unknown,"No, of course not."
09x17,Unknown,You're not my enemy. You're my wife.
09x17,(à la Borat),My wife!
09x17,(normal voice),Right?
09x17,Unknown,No. Sorr... sorry.
09x17,Unknown,We should probably head back.
09x17,Unknown,Do you want to watch the sun come up?
09x17,Unknown,Sure.
09x17,Unknown,Thanks for meeting me here.
09x17,Unknown,"I'm heading over to the East Side to stuff a dead squirrel into a different ex-boyfriend's mailbox, so, you know, this made sense."
09x17,Unknown,Of course.
09x17,Unknown,"So, can I have the locket?"
09x17,Unknown,No.
09x17,Unknown,What? Jeanette...
09x17,Unknown,"Ted, listen to me. You're being crazy."
09x17,Unknown,I'm
09x17,Unknown,being crazy?!
09x17,Unknown,Yes! How long have you been hung up on Robin?
09x17,Unknown,Eight years?!
09x17,Unknown,And you're still k*lling yourself to fetch dumb little trinkets for her. That's crazy!
09x17,Unknown,That's more than crazy.
09x17,Unknown,I don't think there's a word for what that is!
09x17,Unknown,"Actually, there is a word for that. It's ""love."""
09x17,Unknown,"I'm in love with her, okay?"
09x17,Unknown,"If you're looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want, no matter how much it destroys you, it's love!"
09x17,Unknown,"And when you love someone, you just, you... you don't stop, ever."
09x17,Unknown,Even when people roll their eyes or call you crazy.
09x17,Unknown,Even then. Especially then!
09x17,Unknown,"You just-- you don't give up! Because if I could give up... if I could just, you know, take the whole world's advice and-and move on and find someone else, that wouldn't be love."
09x17,Unknown,That would be... that would be some other disposable thing that is not worth fighting for.
09x17,Unknown,But I-- that is not what this is.
09x17,Unknown,"So, please, can I have the locket?"
09x17,Unknown,Cuckoo.
09x17,Unknown,I think we should get back together.
09x17,ROBIN,And... new day.

09x18,Unknown,I am more worried about the vows I have to take with this useless pile of garbage a few hours from now.
09x18,Unknown,What do we do?
09x18,Unknown,You guys see the irony here.
09x18,Unknown,The only person who could possibly get Barney back on his feet is Barney.
09x18,Unknown,"See, over the years, we'd all come to experience something Barney called..."
09x18,Unknown,Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir!
09x18,Unknown,"The most effective post-bender, head's-too-tender ender from here to Denver."
09x18,Unknown,What's in it?
09x18,Unknown,"Glad you asked. Ah, I take it back."
09x18,Unknown,"Columbia University, 1941... I take it back, I take it back."
09x18,Unknown,"President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whom we all know is most famous for being a world-class drunk, commissioned a top-secret scientific project... develop an elixir to cure the common hangover."
09x18,Unknown,And what brilliant scientific mind did boozy old FDR pick to head up this historic task?
09x18,Unknown,Look.
09x18,Unknown,My head really hurts. Let's just speed this along.
09x18,Unknown,"You're clearly ripping off the story of the Manhattan Project, which was run by Dr. Robert Oppenheimer."
09x18,Unknown,So I'm gonna guess it was your distant relative...
09x18,Unknown,...Barnert Stinsonheimer?
09x18,Unknown,Somebody's read their history books.
09x18,Unknown,The Too Many Manhattans Project hit a few snags at first.
09x18,Unknown,The first batch exploded.
09x18,Unknown,Which sounded kind of like this.
09x18,Unknown,Boom! Oh!
09x18,Unknown,You suck.
09x18,Unknown,Just let me finish.
09x18,Unknown,But the second batch...
09x18,Unknown,sadly also exploded.
09x18,Unknown,Boom! Oh!
09x18,Unknown,Why are you here right now?
09x18,Unknown,Do you want to hear the story or not?
09x18,Unknown,Absolutely not. Please leave.
09x18,Unknown,"After some trial and error,"
09x18,Unknown,Dr. Stinsonheimer finally found the magic formula.
09x18,Unknown,Hang on.
09x18,Unknown,Funyuns?
09x18,Unknown,Tantrum Soda?
09x18,Unknown,Sure.
09x18,Unknown,In 1941?
09x18,Unknown,Sure.
09x18,Unknown,They haven't made new Tantrum since then.
09x18,Unknown,That stuff lasts a while.
09x18,Unknown,"Anyway, the elixir was such a success,"
09x18,Unknown,he was awarded the Bro-bel Prize.
09x18,Unknown,True story.
09x18,Unknown,Boom!
09x18,Unknown,Wh-Wh-Why?
09x18,Unknown,That time I was just messing with you.
09x18,Unknown,Just give me the stupid drink.
09x18,Unknown,(groans)
09x18,Unknown,And the craziest part was...
09x18,Unknown,I-I feel better.
09x18,Unknown,"Over the years, each of us would discover that Barney's elixir actually worked."
09x18,Unknown,"Like, way better."
09x18,Unknown,What's in this thing again?
09x18,Unknown,Stinson family secret.
09x18,Unknown,"Oh, come on, you told me most of the ingredients in your story."
09x18,Unknown,Just tell me the secret one.
09x18,Unknown,Ha! I'll never tell you.
09x18,Unknown,I'll take it with me to my grave.
09x18,Unknown,"Damn it, Barney!"
09x18,Unknown,Why are you always so selfish?!
09x18,Unknown,We are trying to help you!
09x18,ROBIN,"Okay, we somehow have to get this leaky barf bag back on his feet before the wedding pictures."
09x18,Unknown,"Well, we know what Barney would want us to do."
09x18,WOMAN,Say cheese.
09x18,ALL,Cheese!
09x18,Unknown,No!
09x18,Unknown,We are not doing Weekend at Barney's!
09x18,Unknown,But that's the dream!
09x18,Unknown,I can't believe I just said that.
09x18,Unknown,Someone suggest something useful!
09x18,Unknown,"Okay, here's the plan."
09x18,Unknown,"Marshall, you and Ted go gather the ingredients we do know."
09x18,Unknown,"Robin, you wake up Barney long enough to find out the secret ingredient."
09x18,And I'll race down to the spa to keep my 8,15 mani and pedi.
09x18,Unknown,"Okay, let's do this!"
09x18,Unknown,b*tch?
09x18,Unknown,Walk out that door and I tag in Zabka as my maid of honor.
09x18,Unknown,"Okay, let's start simple."
09x18,Unknown,Fresh ocean air.
09x18,Unknown,"Come on, baby."
09x18,BOTH,"Come on, honey."
09x18,Unknown,"Come on, love, yeah. Baby, baby."
09x18,Unknown,I'll get the elevator.
09x18,Unknown,"Oh, I should get some water."
09x18,Unknown,"Okay, so... accidentally throwing Barney down the stairs did not wake him up."
09x18,Unknown,Nor did banging his head on each step as we dragged him back up here.
09x18,Unknown,"So, how do we wake him up long enough to tell us the final ingredient?"
09x18,Unknown,"You know, when my sister and I had trouble getting up for school, my dad a few cute little tricks."
09x18,Unknown,(growling)
09x18,Unknown,I'll do it!
09x18,Unknown,I swear to God I'll do it!
09x18,Unknown,Your dad used to do this to you?
09x18,Unknown,"Well, it was with a Cabbage Patch doll and an ax."
09x18,Unknown,But same idea. Trust me.
09x18,Unknown,I was never late for kindergarten again.
09x18,Unknown,What? Come on.
09x18,Unknown,(Barney moaning)
09x18,Unknown,(groans)
09x18,Unknown,I second Marshall's vow.
09x18,Unknown,"I will never, ever get that drunk again."
09x18,Unknown,Yeah. She would.
09x18,Unknown,My baby boy's
09x18,Unknown,in college.
09x18,Unknown,Did you pack enough undies?
09x18,Unknown,"Yes, Mom."
09x18,Unknown,(shushes)
09x18,Unknown,Your father did a lot of puking in these hallowed halls.
09x18,Unknown,From-from binge studying.
09x18,(quietly),Saved it.
09x18,Unknown,"That reminds me, mister."
09x18,Unknown,No underage drinking.
09x18,Unknown,No good comes from hanging out in bars and getting drunk.
09x18,Unknown,But every story from your 20s starts in a bar.
09x18,Unknown,Listen to your mother.
09x18,Unknown,"Oh, what are we gonna do without you in the house?"
09x18,Unknown,(groans)
09x18,Unknown,We got him out of the house! Drink up!
09x18,Unknown,(grunts)
09x18,Unknown,(whoops)
09x18,Unknown,Oh...
09x18,Unknown,You son of a b*tch! You son of a me!
09x18,Unknown,"All right, we got most of the ingredients on our list."
09x18,Unknown,"Ginger, bananas, Funyuns."
09x18,Unknown,I cannot believe that minimart sold Tantrum.
09x18,Unknown,It's been discontinued for years.
09x18,Unknown,"Uh, hey."
09x18,Unknown,(clears throat)
09x18,Unknown,"Will you, uh, toss me that bottle?"
09x18,Unknown,"Oh. Yeah, we haven't done this forever."
09x18,Unknown,(smacks lips)
09x18,Unknown,Dude!
09x18,Unknown,You're a grown man.
09x18,Unknown,Why you throwing a Tantrum?
09x18,Unknown,Nice!
09x18,Unknown,So awesome!
09x18,Unknown,So awesome!
09x18,Unknown,"Okay, there's only one more item on the list and... it's an odd one."
09x18,Unknown,Grease? Grease.
09x18,Unknown,"At the Farhampton Inn, we don't cook with grease."
09x18,Unknown,Our menu is organic.
09x18,Unknown,"Farm to table, locally grown."
09x18,Unknown,"No ""grease."""
09x18,Unknown,"Sir, I am from Minnesota, where every meal is cooked with grease."
09x18,Unknown,"And my father dubbed that food the tastiest eats in the whole gosh darn world, so..."
09x18,Unknown,And how is your father's health?
09x18,Unknown,"Point is, it tastes really good."
09x18,Unknown,"Also, uh, we need it to help a friend recover from a hangover."
09x18,Unknown,Wait a second.
09x18,Unknown,There's bacon right here.
09x18,Unknown,"And where there's bacon, there's bacon grease."
09x18,Unknown,Which we throw out.
09x18,Unknown,And we aren't making any more bacon today.
09x18,Unknown,Not unless it all somehow gets eaten in the ten minutes before breakfast is over.
09x18,Unknown,"No, no, no!"
09x18,Unknown,"Ted, do not give me that look!"
09x18,Unknown,A mountain of food.
09x18,Unknown,A ticking clock? Come on!
09x18,Unknown,You live for this stuff!
09x18,Unknown,"No, I'm not a wild animal."
09x18,Unknown,"I'm a Columbia-educated lawyer, poised to become a judge before age 35."
09x18,Unknown,"And remind me, how did you celebrate getting accepted into Columbia?"
09x18,Unknown,You eat one eight-pound block of fudge in 12 minutes and you're marked for life.
09x18,Unknown,You're not marked for life...
09x18,Unknown,Big Fudge.
09x18,Unknown,"I'm out, okay?"
09x18,Unknown,You eat the bacon.
09x18,Unknown,You know I can't.
09x18,Unknown,I'm allergic. Ted.
09x18,Unknown,I've been trying to tell you this for years.
09x18,Unknown,Your bacon allergy is a lie your mother made up so you'd eat healthy as a kid.
09x18,Unknown,"No, I'm just allergic to a lot of stuff."
09x18,Unknown,"Bacon, doughnuts, Halloween candy."
09x18,Unknown,Not saying thank you.
09x18,Unknown,"Oh, my God!"
09x18,Unknown,That b*tch lied to me!
09x18,Unknown,"Okay, I'll-I'll do it."
09x18,Unknown,"But I... look, I don't, I don't even know if I'll like bacon."
09x18,Unknown,(sniffs)
09x18,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
09x18,Unknown,What do you think?
09x18,Unknown,(choir humming)
09x18,Unknown,I have seen the face of God.
09x18,Unknown,"Okay, there is one thing we haven't tried yet."
09x18,Unknown,Making out with each other.
09x18,Unknown,You really think that will wake him up?
09x18,Unknown,Wake up who now?
09x18,Unknown,(Barney moaning)
09x18,Unknown,(groans)
09x18,Unknown,Look at this soggy bag of snot.
09x18,Unknown,"That's it, I am joining Marshall's vow."
09x18,Unknown,"I am never, ever getting that drunk again."
09x18,Unknown,"Kids, you see where this is going."
09x18,Unknown,Did last night really happen?
09x18,Unknown,I think so.
09x18,Unknown,"Look, let's just agree."
09x18,Unknown,Absolute silence for the rest of the day.
09x18,Unknown,(baby crying)
09x18,Unknown,(groans)
09x18,Unknown,(laughs)
09x18,Unknown,Every time.
09x18,Unknown,You want me to get her?
09x18,Unknown,"No, I got her."
09x18,Unknown,(grunts)
09x18,Unknown,"Yeah, I know, I know."
09x18,Unknown,(shushing)
09x18,Unknown,"Hey, Barney?"
09x18,Unknown,Yeah?
09x18,Unknown,Whose baby is this?
09x18,Unknown,"Uh, pardon."
09x18,Unknown,(speaks French)
09x18,Unknown,"How could you, Mom?!"
09x18,Unknown,You had the map to heaven and you never showed me the way.
09x18,Unknown,May you rot in the bacon-less hell that I've lived in my entire life.
09x18,Unknown,"Yeah, they-they, uh, crisp it up real nice here."
09x18,Unknown,Don't they? Mm-hmm.
09x18,Unknown,What is that... applewood smoked?
09x18,Unknown,"You know what, Ted, you've been going at it real hard."
09x18,Unknown,Why don't you take a breather?
09x18,Unknown,And I'll drive us home.
09x18,Unknown,(growls)
09x18,Unknown,"Well, congratulations."
09x18,Unknown,Here's your grease.
09x18,Unknown,(grunts)
09x18,Unknown,No!
09x18,Unknown,I don't want to lose a finger.
09x18,Unknown,(grunts)
09x18,Unknown,Here. Thanks.
09x18,Unknown,"All right, Ted, let's go."
09x18,Unknown,"No, no!"
09x18,Unknown,"I finally found the one, Marshall."
09x18,Unknown,Her name is Bacon.
09x18,Unknown,"You know, this would go great on one of my mom's LT sandwiches."
09x18,Unknown,"Buddy, you got to take it easy."
09x18,Unknown,Never!
09x18,Unknown,I got a lifetime without bacon to make up for.
09x18,Unknown,"I will keep eating and eating and eating... Oh, God, help me."
09x18,Unknown,I'm going down.
09x18,Unknown,And that's the first and last time I ever ate bacon.
09x18,Unknown,Not everything.
09x18,Unknown,Lily Aldrin?
09x18,Unknown,Let's make out.
09x18,Unknown,(gasps)
09x18,Unknown,Are you sure?!
09x18,Unknown,"Yeah, baby, I'm sure."
09x18,Unknown,"Um... okay, well, you know what? I mean... it probably won't even work."
09x18,Unknown,And it was stupid.
09x18,Unknown,I'm stupid.
09x18,Unknown,(shushing)
09x18,Unknown,You're beautiful.
09x18,Unknown,(gasps)
09x18,Unknown,"More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more."
09x18,Unknown,"Whoa, he's awake!"
09x18,Unknown,How'd you do it?!
09x18,Unknown,Nothing special.
09x18,Unknown,"Hydration, patience."
09x18,Unknown,"Quick, before he passes out again."
09x18,Unknown,Barney!
09x18,Unknown,(grunts)
09x18,Unknown,What's the secret ingredient in Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir?
09x18,Unknown,"Come on, stay with us."
09x18,Unknown,The secret ingredient is... nothing.
09x18,ALL,Huh?
09x18,Unknown,I ate too much bacon.
09x18,Unknown,Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir is a lie.
09x18,Unknown,That's the secret.
09x18,Unknown,You...
09x18,Unknown,"You know, I could use a little lie-down myself."
09x18,Unknown,"So, Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir is a lie?"
09x18,Unknown,Why would you lie about that?
09x18,Unknown,Just to mess with us?
09x18,Unknown,Like that one jerk in every high school who brings in fake mushrooms just to see who's gullible enough to think they're tripping?
09x18,Unknown,"Damn you, Ollie Gunderson."
09x18,Unknown,I knew those shrooms tasted like Sea-Monkeys.
09x18,Unknown,How do you know what Sea-Monkeys taste like?
09x18,Unknown,My older brothers are not... the best people.
09x18,Unknown,Why did you lie?
09x18,Unknown,I... love you guys.
09x18,Unknown,He loves us?
09x18,Unknown,Let's throw him down the stairs again.
09x18,Unknown,Yeah! Yeah!
09x18,Unknown,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Think about it."
09x18,Unknown,"The first time Barney gave us that drink, those hangovers all happened at the worst possible moments."
09x18,Unknown,"Remember? Marshall thought he botched day two of the bar exam, so he freaked out that night and got wasted?"
09x18,Unknown,Now I'm gonna miss the last day of the bar?
09x18,Unknown,I'll never be a lawyer!
09x18,Unknown,I should just go back to being a manager at Structure.
09x18,Unknown,That ten percent off all vests sale?
09x18,Unknown,That was my idea!
09x18,Unknown,As was cutting the arms off all the shirts that weren't selling.
09x18,Unknown,That's where I belong.
09x18,Unknown,"No, Marshall."
09x18,Unknown,You're gonna be a lawyer.
09x18,Unknown,(groans)
09x18,Unknown,"No, I can't do it."
09x18,Unknown,"Yes, you can. Your first day back live on the air is gonna be legend... wait for it... dary!"
09x18,Unknown,Your kindergarten field trip to the jackhammer and siren museum today...
09x18,Unknown,(groans)
09x18,Unknown,...is gonna be legendary.
09x18,Unknown,"No, it's not."
09x18,Unknown,Nothing's ever gonna be legendary again.
09x18,Unknown,I-I'm never gonna recover from this.
09x18,Unknown,"It's just a hangover, Ted."
09x18,Unknown,Not that!
09x18,Unknown,"I got left at the altar, Barney."
09x18,Unknown,I'm now a guy who got left at the altar.
09x18,Unknown,There's no coming back from that.
09x18,Unknown,Drink this.
09x18,Unknown,You're gonna be okay.
09x18,Unknown,Barney made up the Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir so we would all believe that we could rally.
09x18,Unknown,"I mean, even though it's fake, it-it worked."
09x18,Unknown,Like-like Dumbo's feather.
09x18,Unknown,Dum-bro's feather.
09x18,Unknown,A placebo.
09x18,Unknown,Place-bro.
09x18,Unknown,A sugar pill.
09x18,Unknown,(gasps)
09x18,Unknown,I...
09x18,Unknown,He lied so we'd be okay.
09x18,Unknown,Hmm.
09x18,Unknown,Barney does love us.
09x18,Unknown,I wish we could help him out the way he helped us.
09x18,Unknown,But the wedding photos are in 20 minutes.
09x18,Unknown,(groans)
09x18,Unknown,My dad's gonna be so pissed.
09x18,Unknown,Yup.
09x18,Unknown,Barney's a dead man.
09x18,Unknown,(camera shutter clicking)
09x18,Unknown,Barney?
09x18,Unknown,You were always a bit... chatty and blond for my taste. Like a woman.
09x18,Unknown,"But this new side of you... quiet, steady?"
09x18,Unknown,I like it!
09x18,Unknown,"You've earned my respect today, son."
09x18,Unknown,I request the highest of fives.
09x18,Unknown,"Oh, no. Stay cool."
09x18,Unknown,I got this.
09x18,Unknown,I don't believe this.
09x18,Unknown,You did Weekend at Barney's.
09x18,Unknown,And it worked.
09x18,Unknown,"God, today's gonna be all downhill from here."
09x18,Unknown,That's what the bride wants to hear.
09x18,Unknown,"No, that's not what I meant."
09x18,Unknown,I just mean Weekend at Barney's is a thousand times more amazing than our wedding could ever be.
09x18,Unknown,I'm gonna get some more coffee. I can't wait to see the photos!
09x18,Unknown,"Well, he bought it."
09x18,Unknown,We lied out of love.
09x18,Unknown,Look how happy he is.
09x18,Unknown,"I mean, he has no idea we had to cancel the wedding photos and my dad was so angry, he came up to our room and kicked Barney in the crotch."
09x18,Unknown,And the best part is your dad has no idea.
09x18,Unknown,He still loves me.
09x18,Unknown,"Hey, do anyone else's balls hurt?"
09x18,MARSHALL,"And, look, some good came out of all this."
09x18,Unknown,"Seeing you like that, we all vowed never to get that drunk again."
09x18,Unknown,"Well, actually I didn't."
09x18,Unknown,But I will now.
09x18,Unknown,Never again.
09x18,Unknown,Never again. Never again. Never... Ow!
09x18,Unknown,"Kids, no matter how hard we try, even the best of us go a little too wild sometimes."
09x18,Unknown,"And in those moments, we all need someone who loves us to help us rally."
09x18,Unknown,(groans)
09x18,(whispers),Happy New Year. Okay.
09x18,Unknown,"That was, that was way too loud."
09x18,Unknown,You're practically screaming.
09x18,Unknown,What you need is Stinson's Hangover Fixer Elixir.
09x18,Unknown,Even if that means lying once in a while.
09x18,Unknown,Does it work?
09x18,Unknown,Totally works.
09x18,Unknown,(gags)
09x18,Unknown,"It's normal, it's totally normal."
09x18,Unknown,(groans)
09x18,Unknown,(laughs)
09x18,Unknown,I love you so much.
09x18,Unknown,"I love you, too."
09x18,Unknown,"Whoop, whoop."
09x18,Unknown,Better drink it fast.
09x18,BOTH,Mommy!
09x18,Unknown,"Hey, look who it is!"
09x18,Unknown,Get her!
09x18,Unknown,(all clamoring)
09x18,Unknown,I can't believe we kissed today.
09x18,Unknown,Weird.
09x18,Unknown,"I-I feel kind of bad that, um, Ted and Marshall missed it."
09x18,Unknown,"Hey, we should kiss one more time in front of them just to, like, blow their minds."
09x18,Unknown,Right?
09x18,Unknown,"Nah, I don't think so."
09x18,Unknown,"Exactly, totally."
09x18,Unknown,"Ha-ha, guys, you don't get to see this kiss either."
09x18,Unknown,"So, where should we go?"
09x18,Unknown,"Closet, patio?"
09x18,Unknown,"Ooh, I think the sauna's open."
09x18,Unknown,"Well, I... actually... to be honest, it-it felt kind of weird to me."
09x18,Unknown,Once was enough.
09x18,Unknown,Totally.
09x18,Unknown,We could kiss.
09x18,Unknown,We could not kiss.
09x18,Unknown,We could kiss.
09x18,Unknown,Doesn't matter to me.
09x18,Unknown,It's stupid.
09x18,Unknown,I'm stupid.
09x18,Unknown,So stupid.
09x20,Unknown,"It was the day of Barney and Robin's wedding, and a surprise guest had just arrived."
09x20,Unknown,"Mom, I-I can't believe you're here."
09x20,Unknown,How did you get here?
09x20,Unknown,On a plane.
09x20,Unknown,"With your fear of flying? What, did the plane drive here?"
09x20,Unknown,(laughs)
09x20,Unknown,"I've made enormous strides since you last saw me, dear."
09x20,Unknown,This is nice.
09x20,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x20,Unknown,"I don't love flying, I must admit."
09x20,Unknown,"I haven't been on a plane in years, but... maybe this won't be such a bad..."
09x20,PILOT,"Ladies and gentlemen, we are cleared for takeoff."
09x20,Unknown,(screams)

09x20,Unknown,"Oh, I do apologize if I caused any distress."

09x20,Unknown,That is great.
09x20,Unknown,Can you help me get a driver's license?
09x20,Unknown,A what?
09x20,Unknown,"Marshall, you, uh, you don't sound too excited to become a judge."
09x20,Unknown,(sighs) I feel kind of guilty about it.
09x20,Unknown,"I mean, I know how badly Lily wanted to move to Italy."
09x20,Unknown,"Don't do this, bro."
09x20,Unknown,Classic mistake.

09x20,Unknown,You're gonna be a great husband.
09x20,Unknown,"No, no, wait, he has a point."
09x20,Unknown,"I mean, you said yourself, it was her decision."
09x20,Unknown,Lily chose to give up her job and not move to Rome so you could be a judge.
09x20,Unknown,"Yeah, but something seemed off."
09x20,Unknown,"We had this big fight and she stormed out, and when she came back, she had totally, like, changed her mind."
09x20,Unknown,"Wait, what time was this?"
09x20,A little after 3,"00 a.m., Billy Zabka. Why?"
09x20,Unknown,"Well, last night, I was out doing some late-night dirt-biking in the sand."
09x20,Unknown,Naturally. Continue. And I ended up at that EZ Pick a few miles up the road.

09x20,Unknown,I wonder who it was.
09x20,Unknown,What did the license plate say?
09x20,Unknown,It said...
09x20,Unknown,"""AHOY!!!"""
09x20,Unknown,The Captain! Lily's boss.
09x20,Unknown,He has a house out here.
09x20,"Wait, why was Lily getting into the Captain's car at 3",00 in the morning?
09x20,Unknown,Guys...
09x20,Unknown,"I hate to even say this, but... do you think it's possible..."
09x20,Unknown,...that I could eat six of these saltines in under a minute?

09x20,Unknown,"Well, I can't wait to meet this Barney."
09x20,Unknown,"I haven't met him already, have I?"
09x20,Unknown,"Because they said after getting Tasered, I might suffer from short-term memory loss."
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, you'd remember if you'd met Barney."
09x20,Unknown,Why don't I see what he's doing right now?

09x20,Unknown,Robin's mom is here.
09x20,Unknown,And she wants to meet him.
09x20,Unknown,She wants to meet you.
09x20,Unknown,He's kind of in the middle of a saltine challenge at the moment.
09x20,Unknown,"But as soon as he's done, he'll just, uh, pop right over."
09x20,Unknown,All right. Good-bye.
09x20,ROBIN,The saltine challenge?

09x20,Unknown,It's his wedding day.
09x20,Unknown,Guys do weird things on their wedding day.
09x20,Unknown,"Well, on my wedding day, Robin's father completely disappeared for about three hours."
09x20,Unknown,"He just said, ""I've got to go and teach somebody some manners,"" and off he went."
09x20,Unknown,"And then three hours later, he emerged from the woods with a dead elk slung across his shoulder."
09x20,Unknown,And I didn't even know that there
09x20,Unknown,were
09x20,Unknown,elk in Bermuda.
09x20,Unknown,But this Barney... he sounds like a fine young man.
09x20,Unknown,"Yes, he is."
09x20,Unknown,We're going again.
09x20,Unknown,"Marshall, are you okay?"
09x20,Unknown,"Why did she get into the Captain's car, and why didn't she tell me about it?"
09x20,Unknown,"Well, maybe it was a work thing. What? No."
09x20,Unknown,"She has a big fight with me, she goes down to an EZ Pick, she gets into the Captain's Mercedes, and then three hours later, she doesn't want to go to Italy anymore?"
09x20,Unknown,"I mean, do you think this means..."
09x20,Unknown,That the Captain moored his dinghy in Lily's lagoon?
09x20,Unknown,Most definitely.
09x20,Unknown,That's crazy.
09x20,Unknown,You'd never moor a dinghy in a lagoon.
09x20,Unknown,"I don't know, Ted."
09x20,Unknown,"In certain tidal conditions, if you had a protected inlet..."
09x20,Unknown,"Okay, you know what? It doesn't matter."
09x20,Unknown,Today is Barney's wedding.
09x20,Unknown,Let's just forget it.
09x20,Unknown,"Marshall... do you want to go over to the Captain's house right now, punch him in the face really fast and then come back and do this wedding?"
09x20,Unknown,Would that be okay?
09x20,Unknown,"Ranjit, get the car."
09x20,Unknown,Getting the car.
09x20,Unknown,"Baby, I can't wait to meet your mom, but I kind of got to go on a little excursion with the boys right now."

09x20,Unknown,"Oh, sweetie, no."
09x20,Unknown,I'm sure that's not true.
09x20,Unknown,"I mean, th-there's so much you don't know about your father."
09x20,Unknown,"There were... oh, there were so many other red flags in our marriage."
09x20,Unknown,"I mean, for instance, do you know that before he was engaged to me,"

09x20,Unknown,Hello!
09x20,Unknown,Red flag!
09x20,LILY,"Oh, Genevieve, not good."
09x20,Unknown,"And did you know that one time,"
09x20,Unknown,"to impress women, he dressed up like a Prussian aristocrat,"
09x20,Unknown,"had a painting of himself made,"
09x20,Unknown,and posed next to it in an art gallery?

09x20,Unknown,"Oh, that's a rough one."

09x20,Unknown,"Yes, that's exactly what he used to say."
09x20,Unknown,How did you know that?
09x20,Unknown,"Heck of a jab, Marshall."
09x20,Unknown,Well-placed.
09x20,MARSHALL,"Captain, I know something happened between you and Lily last night."
09x20,Unknown,What?
09x20,Unknown,No. Nothing happened.
09x20,Unknown,Captain's honor.
09x20,Unknown,"Well, you can ask my fiancée."
09x20,Unknown,Fiancée? What-what fiancée?
09x20,Unknown,Captain.
09x20,Unknown,Permission to clear things up? Granted.
09x20,Unknown,Me.
09x20,Unknown,We're engaged.
09x20,Unknown,"It's ""boats, boats, boats""!"
09x20,Unknown,"Ted, look! Uh, yeah."

09x20,Unknown,"Boats, boats, boats!"
09x20,Unknown,And only from that commercial.
09x20,Unknown,"No, you banged her."
09x20,Unknown,Remember?
09x20,Unknown,"Like, a bunch of times."
09x20,Unknown,"You knocked ""boots, boots, boots"""""
09x20,MARSHALL,"All right, Captain. What the hell happened here last night?"
09x20,Unknown,"Well, it was just after four bells."
09x20,Unknown,(phone ringing)
09x20,Unknown,Ahoy!
09x20,(choked up),"Hi, I-I know it's late, but I've got to get out of here."
09x20,Unknown,So I sent the car. When she got here...
09x20,Unknown,"Lily, what a lovely..."
09x20,Unknown,Can I use your powder room?
09x20,Unknown,And then she went to the powder room.
09x20,Unknown,"She was in there quite a while, actually."
09x20,Unknown,Probably a deuce. Go on.
09x20,CAPTAIN,"And when she came out, she had to leave right away."
09x20,Unknown,It was odd.
09x20,Unknown,"But I assure you, nothing inappropriate happened between me and your wife."
09x20,Unknown,"Captain, I understand what you're saying, but what you don't understand is that Lily is my wife, and I love her way too much to behave rationally right now!"
09x20,Unknown,En garde!
09x20,Unknown,This is the best day of my life.
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, darling, come on, no, no."
09x20,Unknown,You're not marrying your father.
09x20,Unknown,"I mean, your father..."
09x20,Unknown,"I mean, let's just put it this way."
09x20,Unknown,Your father was a sociopath.
09x20,Unknown,He slept with over 20 women.
09x20,Unknown,"And sure, you know, we were friends for years first and it was entertaining watching him lie to those poor girls to get inside their snow pants, but I should have known back then this was not husband material."
09x20,Unknown,"I mean, even your Uncle Jim, you know, his gay black brother..."
09x20,Unknown,Will you shut up!
09x20,Unknown,Go for Barney!
09x20,Unknown,Your bride is freaking the crap out right now.
09x20,Unknown,Where the hell are you?
09x20,Unknown,"I warn you, Captain, I've pretended to have a duel with actual swords twice."
09x20,Unknown,"I warn you, Marshall, I was on the Olympic fencing team."
09x20,Unknown,Won three gold medals.
09x20,Unknown,"I warn you, Captain, I'm starting to feel like this was a mistake."
09x20,Unknown,I think I'd better not say where I am.
09x20,Unknown,I am not kidding around here!
09x20,Unknown,Tell me where you are!
09x20,Unknown,(sighs)
09x20,Unknown,We're at the Captain's house.
09x20,Unknown,What is it? What's wrong?
09x20,Unknown,I am so busted.
09x20,Unknown,"Thank you, Linus."
09x20,Unknown,You have another piece of gum?
09x20,Unknown,I can keep a secret.
09x20,Unknown,I can keep a secret real good.
09x20,Unknown,Are you chewing gum?
09x20,Unknown,"I can keep a secret like nobody's business, 'cause it is nobody's business."
09x20,Unknown,You never chew gum.
09x20,Unknown,You shouldn't chew gum in here.
09x20,Unknown,"'Cause it's a secret, and I'm keeping it!"
09x20,Unknown,Wait!
09x20,Unknown,Stop the duel!
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, thank God."
09x20,Unknown,"I mean, why?"
09x20,TED,Why?
09x20,Unknown,"Because I just solved the mystery, that's why."
09x20,Unknown,Mosby Boys!
09x20,Unknown,We agreed you wouldn't do that anymore.
09x20,Unknown,Mystery? What mystery?
09x20,Unknown,Lily has a secret.
09x20,Unknown,"She's hiding something, and I know what it is."
09x20,Unknown,"Okay, what is she hiding?"
09x20,Unknown,I'll tell you in a minute.
09x20,Unknown,I want to enjoy the suspense a little bit first.
09x20,Unknown,Ooh.
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, my God, will you just tell us!"
09x20,Unknown,Very well.
09x20,Unknown,"Now, we can all agree that this is the first time I've ever set foot in this house, correct?"
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, this is going to be unbearable."
09x20,Unknown,"Now, Captain, your powder room... does it face out on the ocean?"
09x20,Unknown,"Of course, right over the cliff."
09x20,Unknown,Just as I suspected.
09x20,Unknown,"And if I were to walk into this powder room right now, I believe I'd see a potted plant of some sort."
09x20,Unknown,Is that correct?
09x20,Unknown,Yes. There's a daisy.
09x20,Unknown,A daisy. Interesting.
09x20,Unknown,"Uh, not traditionally an indoor plant, but I suppose it gets plenty of light with the southern exposure."
09x20,Unknown,"That's right, it does."
09x20,Unknown,Will you please fetch the daisy?
09x20,Unknown,Aye-aye.
09x20,Unknown,I totally solved it.
09x20,Unknown,You didn't solve it.
09x20,Unknown,You didn't solve it.
09x20,Unknown,You didn't solve it.
09x20,Unknown,You didn't solve it.
09x20,Unknown,"Did you solve...? No, you didn't solve it."
09x20,Unknown,I solved it!
09x20,Unknown,Ah.
09x20,Unknown,"Thank you, Captain."
09x20,Unknown,Now... a simple question.
09x20,Unknown,"When Lily and Marshall are apart for an extended period of time, what is the one thing Lily always does?"
09x20,Unknown,Cry?
09x20,Unknown,Masturbate?
09x20,Unknown,Karate?
09x20,Unknown,Go sailing?
09x20,Unknown,No.
09x20,Unknown,"When Lily and Marshall are apart for a long period of time, Lily... always..."
09x20,Unknown,...starts smoking again.
09x20,Unknown,"That's true, she does."
09x20,Unknown,Happened when she went to Paris in college.
09x20,Unknown,"It happened when she moved to San Francisco, and last week,"
09x20,Unknown,it happened again.
09x20,Unknown,"From the moment Marshall left for Minnesota, Lily's been secretly puffing down the ciggies like a 46-year-old grandma at a Reno slot machine."
09x20,Unknown,"Problem was, come Friday morning, she knew she'd have to quit again,cold turkey."
09x20,Unknown,And it wouldn't be easy.
09x20,Unknown,"She tried to make it a whole car ride without a fix, but couldn't."
09x20,Unknown,"So, she pretended to be annoyed by perfectly reasonable things,"
09x20,Unknown,like my stylish driving gloves and my appreciation of the historic van Otterloop manse.
09x20,Unknown,All so she could have one last smoke on the train.
09x20,Unknown,"But afterwards, her breath told the tale."
09x20,Unknown,"And that's why, when she got to the hotel, Lily... was chewing... gum."
09x20,Unknown,Lily never chews gum.
09x20,Unknown,What? Never?
09x20,Unknown,"Well, hardly ever."
09x20,Unknown,"Great job, Ted."
09x20,Unknown,That's some pretty solid evidence. Gum.
09x20,(laughing),"Oh, Barney, my dear boy."
09x20,Unknown,I'm just getting started.
09x20,Unknown,Getting started?
09x20,Unknown,Lily knew that cigarette was probably her last for a while.
09x20,Unknown,"She needed something to keep her nerves calm, so she headed to the bar."
09x20,Unknown,"Anytime you see me without a drink in my hand, you put a drink in my hand."
09x20,Unknown,"Are you my guy, Linus?"
09x20,Unknown,What followed was a long day and a half for Lily.
09x20,Unknown,A really long day and a half.
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, it's kind of insane how much happened in just a day and a half."
09x20,Unknown,"Anyway, Marshall returned, they had a big fight, Lily stormed out."
09x20,Unknown,"And that's when she realized, if she was gonna sneak one this weekend, this was her chance."
09x20,Unknown,"And after that fight, boy, did she need one."
09x20,Only problem,she was all out.
09x20,Unknown,"Now,"
09x20,it's 3,"00 a.m., you need a cigarette, and the only place that's open is an EZ Pick that's five miles down the road."
09x20,Unknown,You have no car.
09x20,Unknown,What do you do? Go.
09x20,Unknown,Dirt-bike it.
09x20,Unknown,I can walk that far.
09x20,Unknown,Masturbate.
09x20,Unknown,Take a boat.
09x20,Unknown,What? A boat? No.
09x20,Unknown,"Dude, she got a ride in your car, remember?"
09x20,Unknown,(phone ringing)
09x20,Unknown,Ahoy.
09x20,Unknown,"Hi. I-I know it's late, but I've got to get out of here."
09x20,Unknown,I want to make one stop first.
09x20,Unknown,"The problem was, Lily didn't want to smoke in front of her new employer."
09x20,Unknown,"So, when she arrived at the Captain's house, there was only one possible course of action."
09x20,Unknown,Can I use your powder room?
09x20,Unknown,"Now,"
09x20,Unknown,you're Lily.
09x20,Unknown,You've just had a cigarette in your boss's powder room.
09x20,Unknown,What do you do with the cigarette butt?
09x20,Unknown,Throw it out the window? Flush it?
09x20,Unknown,"No, she-she wouldn't do either of those things."
09x20,Unknown,She's an environmentalist.
09x20,Unknown,Stick it in your purse?
09x20,Unknown,Marshall could find it there.
09x20,Unknown,Throw it in the trash can.
09x20,Unknown,The Captain would find it there.
09x20,Unknown,Hide it in a boat.
09x20,Unknown,A boat? Wait. How would that...
09x20,Unknown,I don't know.
09x20,Unknown,I just... I like boats.
09x20,Unknown,No.
09x20,Unknown,There's only one place that she would put it.
09x20,Unknown,"A place where, eventually, it would decompose and serve as a natural mulch."
09x20,Unknown,It's in the daisy.
09x20,Unknown,"And sure enough, if I dig around..."
09x20,Unknown,I am all but guaranteed to find...
09x20,Unknown,A pregnancy test.
09x20,Unknown,You could smoke those?
09x20,Unknown,(vomiting)
09x20,Unknown,(panting)
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, no."
09x20,Unknown,"So, you want the Kennedy package?"
09x20,Unknown,Bingo.
09x20,Unknown,One other little thing.
09x20,Unknown,"When you do put a drink in my hand, let's make it non-alcoholic."
09x20,Unknown,There's a chance I might be pregnant.
09x20,Unknown,"Okay, Linus, don't start popping the sparkling cider just yet."
09x20,Unknown,I'm just being cautious.
09x20,Unknown,I'll take a test when I get home.
09x20,Unknown,It can wait.
09x20,Unknown,Are Marvin and I and any other future children we may have just some consolation prize?
09x20,Unknown,I have to get out of here.
09x20,Unknown,♪
09x20,Unknown,(sighs)
09x20,Unknown,It can't wait.
09x20,Unknown,♪
09x20,Unknown,"Lily, what a lovely..."
09x20,Unknown,Can I use your powder room?
09x20,Unknown,♪
09x20,Unknown,Two minutes. Here we go.
09x20,Unknown,♪
09x20,Unknown,"Guys, we need to go back to the hotel."
09x20,Unknown,"Lily peed on that, and you touched it."
09x20,Unknown,Lily?
09x20,Unknown,We're gonna have a baby?
09x20,Unknown,I told you guys I could keep a secret.
09x20,Unknown,"Uh, uh, Barney, this-this is my mom."
09x20,Unknown,Hi. Hello.
09x20,Unknown,Oh.
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, he's a hugger."
09x20,Unknown,Nothing like your dad.
09x20,Unknown,(laughs)
09x20,Unknown,I'm sorry. I-I was gonna tell you tonight.
09x20,Unknown,"No. Oh, my God, no. It's fine."
09x20,Unknown,There's just... there's so much we have to do.
09x20,Unknown,"You know, we have to, um... we have to do research on... uh, hospitals in Italy, and we have to, uh..."
09x20,Unknown,We're not going to Italy.
09x20,Unknown,Of course we are.
09x20,Unknown,"Lily, we have to do this."
09x20,Unknown,"You're gonna live in Rome, and you're gonna get your dream, because... because you're giving me mine."
09x20,Unknown,Again.
09x20,Unknown,"But there's gonna be all sorts of paperwork, and-and if she's born outside of the U.S., she could never become president."
09x20,Unknown,It's a girl?
09x20,Unknown,"Oh. I don't know, but... in my mind, I kind of think she is."
09x20,Unknown,Oh.
09x20,Unknown,I love you so much.
09x20,Unknown,Mmm.
09x20,Unknown,We're gonna give you some privacy.
09x20,Unknown,It's my room. Why do I have to...?
09x20,Unknown,Just... come on.
09x20,Unknown,"I thought this was an exit. No, balcony."
09x20,Unknown,Ah. Oh.
09x20,Unknown,"Well, we'll just give them a few minutes, and then..."
09x20,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
09x20,Unknown,...we'll go back in and...
09x20,Unknown,Oh.
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, they are both naked."
09x20,Unknown,"Yeah, they work fast."
09x20,Unknown,Yes. (sighs)
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, darling."

09x20,Unknown,"You know, for every marriage in the world like I had with your dad, you know, there's... there's a marriage like those two in there."
09x20,Unknown,"And, oh, marriage is..."
09x20,Unknown,"Oh, it's terrifying."
09x20,Unknown,It's-it's like flying.
09x20,Unknown,"You know, you're-you're filled with this mortal dread, but if you find someone you feel safe with, it's like flying!"
09x20,Unknown,"But if you got someone that you feel is really there for you, someone you can depend on, you're gonna be fine."
09x20,Unknown,Do you have someone like that?
09x21,TED,Hi.
09x21,Unknown,Hi.
09x21,Unknown,Okay.
09x21,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x21,Unknown,So I thought we'd... try this new restaurant.
09x21,Unknown,It's right around the corner from here.
09x21,Unknown,It's Scottish-Mexican fusion.
09x21,Unknown,Scottish-Mexican fusion?
09x21,Unknown,Scottish-Mexican fusion.
09x21,Unknown,That would seem like two things that do not fuse.
09x21,Unknown,Perhaps you'll change your mind when you try their signature haggis enchiladas.
09x21,Unknown,(laughs) Okay.
09x21,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x21,Unknown,"All right. Yeah, come on. Lead the way."
09x21,Unknown,I was surprised when you called.
09x21,Unknown,Isn't there some universal guy rule where you have to wait four days to call a girl?
09x21,Unknown,That... does not ring a bell.
09x21,Unknown,And it's three days.
09x21,Unknown,(laughs)
09x21,Unknown,Here we are.
09x21,Unknown,(bagpipes and trumpets playing mariachi music)
09x21,Unknown,"Uh, I did not realize there would be live music."
09x21,Unknown,"So, uh, should we..."
09x21,Unknown,Eat anywhere but here?
09x21,(laughs),Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
09x21,Unknown,"Besides, I'm sure we can find a place where we don't need reservations."
09x21,Unknown,"Oh, you think it's just that easy?"
09x21,Unknown,Just stroll in off the street and get a meal?
09x21,Unknown,"Well, let me tell you the tale of Gary Blauman."
09x21,Unknown,There's the blushing bride!
09x21,Unknown,Oh!
09x21,Unknown,Gary Blauman!
09x21,Unknown,How are you?!
09x21,Unknown,"Uh, duh, like I need to ask."
09x21,Unknown,You're getting married.
09x21,Unknown,"Well, don't let me keep you. You have things to do."
09x21,Unknown,I will see you walking down the aisle.
09x21,Unknown,I'll be the guy in the eighth row going like this.
09x21,Unknown,(laughs) Right?! Right.
09x21,Unknown,Good luck today! Thank you.
09x21,Unknown,Okay.
09x21,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x21,Unknown,"Hey, there's the blushing bride..."
09x21,Unknown,Code red!
09x21,Unknown,♪ How I Met Your Mother 9x21 ♪
09x21,Unknown,Gary Blauman
09x21,Unknown,"Original Air Date on March 17, 2014"
09x21,Unknown,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! Why the code red?"
09x21,Unknown,"I mean, if it's... if it's about your hair, I didn't even notice; especially not from the back."
09x21,Unknown,What? Nothing.
09x21,Unknown,"Gary Blauman is here, and I had no idea he was coming."
09x21,Unknown,His reply card must've gotten lost in the mail.
09x21,Unknown,"I mean, where's he gonna sit?"
09x21,Unknown,It took us weeks to plan the seating chart!
09x21,Unknown,Robin.
09x21,Unknown,Shh.
09x21,Unknown,I got you. Huh?
09x21,Unknown,You're talking to the seating chart master.
09x21,Unknown,"At my own wedding, I managed to sit small-town Minnesotans right next to liberal New Yorkers with grace"
09x21,Unknown,and
09x21,Unknown,aplomb.
09x21,Unknown,Table 27 still gets together once a year for a reunion.
09x21,Unknown,Perhaps you've seen their photos on Facebook.
09x21,Unknown,Like I said...
09x21,(whispers),I got you.
09x21,Unknown,"Thanks, Marshall."
09x21,Unknown,(door closes)
09x21,Unknown,Code red!
09x21,Unknown,"Grandma's sitting next to the band, divorced couple sitting one table away from each other, no coherent singles table."
09x21,Unknown,This is the Robin's hair of seating charts.
09x21,Unknown,Singles tables are cruel.
09x21,Unknown,"I mean, what if you went to a wedding and there was a table of all fat guys?"
09x21,Unknown,"That would be awesome. You're right, it would."
09x21,Unknown,"Let's crack this Gary Blauman nut first, and then we'll work on the fat guy table."
09x21,Unknown,"Wait, did you say Gary Blauman?"
09x21,Unknown,Yeah. Why?
09x21,Unknown,I... hate... that guy.
09x21,Unknown,Why?
09x21,Unknown,Remember a few years ago when I read that biography of Teddy Roosevelt?
09x21,Unknown,"For weeks after I read it, I only wanted to talk about one thing."
09x21,Unknown,Teddy Roosevelt was the coolest guy ever!
09x21,Unknown,(others grumbling)
09x21,Unknown,"Oh, that's it! No more books, Ted."
09x21,Unknown,I don't like the person you become when you read books.
09x21,Here's the deal,you get to tell us one more interesting fact about Teddy Roosevelt.
09x21,Unknown,"One more, and then you're done forever."
09x21,Unknown,So make it a good one.
09x21,Unknown,Okay.
09x21,Unknown,He went blind in one eye... from getting hit too hard in a boxing match...
09x21,Unknown,...while he was president!
09x21,Unknown,That's a pretty good one. Wow.
09x21,Unknown,That is kind of...
09x21,Unknown,"Right?! Oh, and when he was at Harvard..."
09x21,Unknown,"No! No! Shut up! Oh, my God! Please!"
09x21,Unknown,"Well, one night, we were throwing a party to celebrate... something--"
09x21,Unknown,I-I can't remember what... when a pretty girl I had never met noticed the book on the coffee table.
09x21,Unknown,I can't believe you have this book.
09x21,Unknown,I just finished reading it.
09x21,Unknown,Teddy Roosevelt was the coolest guy ever.
09x21,Unknown,A unicorn.
09x21,Unknown,I couldn't believe it.
09x21,Unknown,It was a stroke of luck on par
09x21,Unknown,with the 50-page manuscript in Roosevelt's breast pocket that helped slow that would-be assassin's b*llet.
09x21,Unknown,"Dude, come on."
09x21,Unknown,Sorry. Anyway... enter Gary Blauman.
09x21,Unknown,Is that the Teddy Roosevelt biography?
09x21,Unknown,Coolest guy ever.
09x21,Unknown,Right? Right?
09x21,Unknown,Right? Right?
09x21,Unknown,Right? Right? Right?
09x21,Unknown,So the three of us started talking Teddy Roosevelt.
09x21,Unknown,When he took that four-minute flight on the Wright brother's plane?
09x21,Unknown,So cool.
09x21,Unknown,The time he climbed the tallest mountain in Europe on his honeymoon.
09x21,Unknown,So cool.
09x21,Unknown,"And that's when I realized, Blauman and I were locked in a battle of wills that made T.R.'s charge up San Juan Hill look like a walk in the park."
09x21,Unknown,"Or should I say, in the national park, since it was Roosevelt who spearheaded the establishment..."
09x21,Unknown,"Dude, come on. I gave you one."
09x21,Unknown,The battle raged on.
09x21,Unknown,"In a way, he was..."
09x21,ALL,...the archetype of the modern politician!
09x21,Unknown,(all laugh)
09x21,Unknown,"Dude, knock it off."
09x21,Unknown,"Knock what off, bro?"
09x21,Unknown,"This is my apartment, my Teddy Roosevelt conversation, I get the girl."
09x21,Unknown,"Oh, so the fact that you're the incumbent means she should just pick you?"
09x21,Unknown,Tell that to William Howard Taft.
09x21,Unknown,You're calling me Taft?
09x21,Unknown,"If anyone's Taft, you're Taft!"
09x21,Unknown,I'm not Taft! I'm Teddy!
09x21,Unknown,The hell you are. My name is Ted!
09x21,Unknown,"Yeah, right. Go sign the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act, Taft!"
09x21,Unknown,(gasps)How dare you?
09x21,Unknown,Skinny-dipping in the Potomac River.
09x21,Unknown,(all laugh)
09x21,Unknown,"And so the standoff continued, hours passed... then days."
09x21,Unknown,Days passed? Days passed.
09x21,Unknown,"Finally, a T.R. stricken by tropical fever on his Amazon trek, we could go no further."
09x21,Unknown,When he was Assistant Secretary of the Navy...
09x21,Unknown,Will you just pick one of us already so I can either have sex or go to sleep!
09x21,Unknown,"Smooth, bro."
09x21,Unknown,"After that day, I have never liked that guy."
09x21,Unknown,"So let's just tell Robin this can't be done, and send Gary Blauman packing."
09x21,LILY,Did you just say Gary Blauman?
09x21,Unknown,Yeah.
09x21,Unknown,I... love that guy!
09x21,Unknown,What?! He's the devil!
09x21,Unknown,He's an angel.
09x21,Unknown,"It was 2006, Marshall and I had broken up, and I was back in New York feeling vulnerable and listening to my breakup song over and over."
09x21,Unknown,"Sugar Ray's ""Fly."" You know it."
09x21,Unknown,"Man, you know nothing about breakups."
09x21,Unknown,I really don't.
09x21,Unknown,"Anyway, then I hit bottom."
09x21,Unknown,There's a bottom below Sugar Ray?
09x21,Unknown,Mm.
09x21,Unknown,What?!
09x21,Unknown,Why have I never seen that before?
09x21,Unknown,I've been using cover-up and strategically placed straps for a long time to keep this puppy quiet.
09x21,Unknown,After all the times you guys made fun of me for my breakup butterfly tattoo?
09x21,Unknown,(Lily and Marshall snicker)
09x21,Unknown,"Oh, the fact that Ted got a butterfly tattoo, will you ever stop being hilarious?"
09x21,Unknown,So why is it only half a butterfly?
09x21,Unknown,"Because Gary Blauman saw me in the tattoo parlor, dragged me out and talked some sense into me."
09x21,Unknown,"Lily, trust me, you and Marshall are going to get back together."
09x21,Unknown,"And when you do, you will be so glad you did not get the other half of that butterfly."
09x21,Unknown,"Actually, I was gonna get a little more than the butterfly."
09x21,Unknown,It's good that I ran into you.
09x21,Unknown,"Marshall, Blauman saved you from a lifetime of looking at Sugar Ray every time we do it on your birthday."
09x21,Unknown,Find him a nice seat.
09x21,Unknown,"No, no, do not find him a seat."
09x21,Unknown,"I'm telling you, this guy... You find him a nice..."
09x21,Unknown,"Neither of us was gonna back down,"
09x21,Unknown,so finally we decided to take it to the groom.
09x21,Unknown,(gasps)
09x21,Unknown,Wh-What's going on? Shh!
09x21,Unknown,Wha...?
09x21,Unknown,Who's that guy?
09x21,Unknown,It's my ex-boyfriend.
09x21,Unknown,"So, we're crouching behind a van, hiding from your ex-boyfriend."
09x21,Unknown,"Forgive me, I'm a little bit of a detective."
09x21,Unknown,It was a bad breakup?
09x21,Unknown,Pretty bad.
09x21,Unknown,Bad like there was a big fight?
09x21,Unknown,Bad like there was a big ring.
09x21,Unknown,Bad like this happened in the past year?
09x21,Unknown,Bad like it happened Saturday.
09x21,Unknown,So bad.
09x21,Unknown,Yeah.
09x21,Unknown,"Okay, he's gone."
09x21,Unknown,"I'm so sorry, Ted."
09x21,Unknown,"I really like you, but I'm-I'm in the weirdest place on Earth right now."
09x21,Unknown,You're in a Scottish-Mexican restaurant?
09x21,Unknown,(laughs)
09x21,Unknown,Yup.
09x21,Unknown,"Yeah, I am."
09x21,Unknown,It's just too soon for me to be dating.
09x21,Unknown,I think I should head home.
09x21,Unknown,"Well, want me to walk with you?"
09x21,Unknown,Lots of scary ex-boyfriends in this neighborhood.
09x21,Unknown,Sure.
09x21,Unknown,I do want to hear the rest of that story.
09x21,Unknown,"Right, right the story."
09x21,Unknown,Yeah.
09x21,Unknown,"So, we decided to take it to the groom."
09x21,Unknown,Did you say Gary Blauman?
09x21,Unknown,Yeah.
09x21,Unknown,Gary Blauman?
09x21,Unknown,Yes.
09x21,Unknown,"Blauman... comma, Gary?"
09x21,Unknown,"Point, comma, get to the damn."
09x21,Unknown,I... love... that we have the opportunity to destroy Gary Blauman's weekend by kicking him out of the wedding!
09x21,Unknown,Yes! Gary Blauman Haters' Club right here!
09x21,Unknown,What that guy did to me.
09x21,Unknown,Oh... God!
09x21,Unknown,It makes me furious to this day!
09x21,Unknown,"Okay, okay, I'm gonna try and tell this story without completely losing it."
09x21,Unknown,"Ready? Okay, here goes."
09x21,Unknown,I was at the... (growls)
09x21,Unknown,(growls)
09x21,Unknown,"Nope, not gonna happen. Give me a second."
09x21,Unknown,Ooh! Ooh!
09x21,Unknown,I was at the bar.
09x21,Unknown,"Hey, Barney!"
09x21,Unknown,"What's up, Blauman? Have a seat."
09x21,Unknown,"Oh, thanks."
09x21,Unknown,Your fries. Need anything?
09x21,Unknown,"I'm good, thanks."
09x21,Unknown,"Oh, but he was not good, thanks."
09x21,Unknown,"He was not good, thanks, at all!"
09x21,Unknown,"Oh, what? Did he take one of your fries?"
09x21,Unknown,Take one?
09x21,Unknown,Take one?
09x21,Unknown,"Lily, it would have been one thing if he took one of my fries; that would have been one thing."
09x21,Unknown,"No, Lily, that day, Blauman took..."
09x21,Unknown,...four of my fries!
09x21,Unknown,But that's not even the capper!
09x21,Here's the part that still keeps me up at night,the fourth fry he took...
09x21,(yells),the fourth fry he took...
09x21,Unknown,(grunting)
09x21,Unknown,"Buddy, you oka... you okay?"
09x21,Unknown,(grunting)
09x21,Unknown,The fourth fry he took...
09x21,Unknown,...was an accidental curly.
09x21,Unknown,(both gasp)
09x21,Unknown,You don't take a man's accidental curly.
09x21,MARSHALL,You take a man's wife before you take his accidental curly.
09x21,LILY,"If you wanted curly fries so bad, why not just order them in the first place?"
09x21,Unknown,(laughs)
09x21,Unknown,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
09x21,Unknown,'Cause that's what you want.
09x21,Unknown,All curly fries.
09x21,Unknown,(laughs)
09x21,Unknown,Regular cut with a few accidental curlies.
09x21,Unknown,That's what you want.
09x21,Unknown,That's the dream. He's right.
09x21,Unknown,That is the dream. No!
09x21,Unknown,"I refuse to look down from the altar as I say my vows to the woman of my dreams, and see that damned, stupid, accidental-curly-fry-stealing Gary Blauman!"
09x21,Unknown,Did you say Gary Blauman?
09x21,Unknown,I... hate... to disagree with Barney.
09x21,Unknown,But I love that guy!
09x21,Unknown,I just met him earlier today.
09x21,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh!"
09x21,Unknown,It's you.
09x21,Unknown,Yeah.
09x21,Unknown,You're the poet William Zabka.
09x21,Unknown,Nobody ever recognizes me for my poetry.
09x21,Unknown,He has all six of my collections.
09x21,Unknown,When Terry Gross interviewed me on
09x21,Unknown,"Fresh Air,"
09x21,Unknown,he listened live.
09x21,Unknown,Gary Blauman rules!
09x21,Unknown,Gary Blauman?
09x21,Unknown,I... hate...
09x21,Unknown,...that I once thought I loved Gary Blauman.
09x21,Unknown,"Ooh, this sounds good."
09x21,Unknown,Gary's the guy that I had an affair with.
09x21,Unknown,"Tom found out, threw me out of the house."
09x21,Unknown,Now the kids are from a broken home.
09x21,Unknown,"Because of Gary Blauman, everything that matters to me is gone."
09x21,Unknown,I got that beat.
09x21,Unknown,"So, I was ordering these fries..."
09x21,Unknown,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
09x21,Unknown,Blauman's gay?
09x21,Unknown,"Well... then that means that night, the real battle was between Blauman and the girl."
09x21,Unknown,And the prize... was this guy.
09x21,Unknown,(all groaning)
09x21,Unknown,"Keep telling yourself that, buddy."
09x21,Unknown,I don't want to see Gary Blauman at my brother's wedding.
09x21,Unknown,Neither do I!
09x21,Unknown,"I'm the brother in question! Now, now, hold on."
09x21,Unknown,(all arguing)
09x21,Unknown,Order! Order!
09x21,Unknown,"Robin put this on my plate, and so I'll make the decision."
09x21,Unknown,"Now, let's take a short recess."
09x21,Unknown,Everybody out.
09x21,Unknown,Okay.
09x21,Unknown,"Lily, out of court settlement."
09x21,Unknown,"Drop this whole thing, and I'll give you ten bucks."
09x21,Unknown,No.
09x21,Unknown,I can't go higher than ten.
09x21,Unknown,(clears throat)
09x21,Unknown,I'm ready to give my decision.
09x21,Unknown,This was a tough one.
09x21,Unknown,Lot of good points on both sides.
09x21,Unknown,But ultimately... Blauman stays.
09x21,Unknown,Yeah. What in the...?
09x21,Unknown,For one simple reason.
09x21,Unknown,There is a higher law at every wedding.
09x21,Unknown,A law that trumps all other arguments.
09x21,Unknown,"When the bride asks for something, she gets it."
09x21,Unknown,Yes.
09x21,Wow. ZABKA,Good point.
09x21,Unknown,He's right.
09x21,Unknown,This fake court thing is adjourned.
09x21,Unknown,Judged.
09x21,Unknown,"Well, I guess let's go find Blauman and tell him the good news."
09x21,Unknown,"Yeah, about that. Bit of a wrinkle."
09x21,Unknown,"I was just in the hallway, ran into Blauman."
09x21,Unknown,"I told him if he didn't leave immediately, then Billy Zabka was gonna crane-kick him in the face."
09x21,Unknown,What?!
09x21,Unknown,But that's not even my move!
09x21,Unknown,I...
09x21,Unknown,We have to stop him.
09x21,Unknown,Barney! I... (sighs)
09x21,Unknown,"Come on, come on, come on."
09x21,Unknown,"So, we all run out to the parking lot to stop Gary Blauman from leaving the wedding..."
09x21,Unknown,What are you doing?
09x21,Unknown,This is my place.
09x21,Unknown,Oh.
09x21,Unknown,"So, uh... well, I guess this... this is where I leave you."
09x21,Unknown,This is your place.
09x21,Unknown,Yup.
09x21,Unknown,You sure it's not a few blocks that way?
09x21,Unknown,"Nope, it's right here."
09x21,Unknown,It's right where you picked me up.
09x21,Unknown,So it is.
09x21,Unknown,Well... good night.
09x21,Unknown,Good night.
09x21,Unknown,"Eight years earlier, I probably would've given some embarrassing speech, confessed my love and scared her off."
09x21,Unknown,But I didn't.
09x21,Unknown,Because somehow I just knew this was all gonna work out.
09x21,Unknown,"Ted? Oh, thank God."
09x21,Unknown,Do you at least want to finish your story?
09x21,Unknown,Right.
09x21,Unknown,"So, we all ran out to the parking lot, and..."
09x21,Unknown,"Blauman, Blauman, I'm sorry."
09x21,Unknown,You can stay. Billy won't kick you in the face.
09x21,Unknown,It's not even my move.
09x21,Unknown,"If I was gonna do anything, I'd sweep the leg, and put you in a body bag; everyone knows that."
09x21,Unknown,What...? Is that from one of your poems?
09x21,Unknown,Thank you for that.
09x21,Unknown,"Please stick around, for the bride."
09x21,Unknown,"You're not a Taft. Even if you are, Roosevelt shouldn't have divided the party like that."
09x21,Unknown,"I mean, he handed the election to Wilson."
09x21,Unknown,"Completely, right? Right? Right?"
09x21,Unknown,(laughs)
09x21,Unknown,"No, wait! No! All right?"
09x21,Unknown,Forget it!
09x21,Unknown,"And, James, I'm sorry about you and Tom."
09x21,Unknown,But you have to stop blaming me for your own decisions.
09x21,Unknown,"Well, guys, take a good look."
09x21,Unknown,This face you won't be seeing again.
09x21,Unknown,Come...
09x21,Unknown,The bri... the bri...
09x21,Unknown,Gary?
09x21,Unknown,He's really leaving.
09x21,Unknown,"Hey, Barney."
09x21,Unknown,"You still, uh, have my wedding ring?"
09x21,(quietly),Yeah.
09x21,Unknown,I've got some work to do.
09x21,Unknown,Excuse me.
09x21,Unknown,Blauman will cool off eventually.
09x21,Unknown,We'll see him again.
09x21,Unknown,Of course we will.
09x21,MARSHALL,I don't know.
09x21,Unknown,"I mean, we might really never see him again."
09x21,Unknown,"Because I remember at our wedding looking out and thinking, ""Man, everyone here means so much to me."""
09x21,Unknown,"A bunch of those people, you know, I haven't seen them since."
09x21,Unknown,"And that's how it goes, kids."
09x21,Unknown,"The friends, neighbors, drinking buddies and partners in crime you love so much when you're young, as the years go by, you just lose touch."
09x21,Unknown,"That being said, I did manage to keep track of a few people."
09x21,Unknown,Carl's still behind the bar at MacLaren's.
09x21,Unknown,"Hey, watch it over there."
09x21,Unknown,"Yeah, watch it over there!"
09x21,Unknown,It's become a family business.
09x21,Unknown,Jeanette was arrested for mailing jars of urine to Val Kilmer.

09x21,Unknown,I'm sorry for storming off like that.
09x21,Unknown,I don't want to miss this wedding.
09x21,Unknown,"You will be shocked, kids, when you discover how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever."
09x21,Unknown,"That's why when you find someone you want to keep around, you do something about it."
09x21,Unknown,"So, I guess... good night."

09x22,Unknown,"No, no. Sorry. I refuse to be a part of a third runaway bride situation."
09x22,Unknown,It's like the dude in that documentary who kept having women show up dead at the bottom of his staircase.
09x22,Unknown,"Sure, maybe they all tripped, but it's like, do you want to hang out with that guy?"
09x22,Unknown,"God, you're gonna think I'm insane, but..."
09x22,Unknown,I still think that it's a bad sign I never found that locket.
09x22,Unknown,Some part of me thought that Barney would magically find it.
09x22,Unknown,I know.
09x22,Unknown,"I know that's unfair of me to expect that, but... you know, I want to be with a guy who comes through for me, you know?"
09x22,Unknown,"The guy who, somehow, against all odds, finds my locket."

09x22,Unknown,"I'm writing my vows to Robin, but I want them to be profound and inspiring, as if they were written by the bard himself, Lionel Richie."
09x22,Unknown,Then why did you wait until right before the wedding to compose them?
09x22,Unknown,I didn't. I've been trying to get these right for weeks. Oh.
09x22,Unknown,This is a lot of vows.
09x22,Unknown,Vow-za.

09x22,Unknown,(knocking)
09x22,Unknown,Yeah.
09x22,Unknown,Hey. You asked for me?
09x22,Unknown,Look what Barney just gave me.
09x22,Unknown,No way!
09x22,Unknown,See? Barney came through.
09x22,Unknown,There's your sign.
09x22,Unknown,You're good to go.
09x22,Unknown,"Where'd you find the locket, Ted?"
09x22,Unknown,Where did you find the locket?
09x22,Unknown,Me? Why-why are you asking me?
09x22,Unknown,Barney found it. Ask him.
09x22,Unknown,"What, you lost a locket?"
09x22,Unknown,"Barney wouldn't tell me how he found it, which made me realize it had to be you."
09x22,(laughs),Okay.
09x22,Unknown,I'll embarrass him.
09x22,Unknown,"Your fiancé got a metal detector and scoured a 10,000-square-foot grid around that carousel."
09x22,Unknown,Guess where he found it.
09x22,Unknown,The nest of a mama pigeon.
09x22,(laughs),Barney had to wrestle it away from four baby pigeons.
09x22,Unknown,But here's where the story gets bittersweet.
09x22,Unknown,I lied. Barney said it was in Marshall and Lily's basement.
09x22,Unknown,But do you still want to finish your little pigeon story?
09x22,Unknown,The mama pigeon gets k*lled by a cab.
09x22,Unknown,Barney still goes back to the park every day to feed the babies. The end.
09x22,Unknown,Tell me the truth.
09x22,Unknown,"Okay, I-I tracked it down, and I gave it to Barney to give to you."
09x22,Unknown,"Honestly, it was no big deal."
09x22,Unknown,How did you find it?
09x22,Unknown,Psh. How does anybody find anything?
09x22,Unknown,You hear it might be in your race car pencil box. It's not there.
09x22,Unknown,So you swing by your ex-fiancée's storage locker on the opposite coast.
09x22,Unknown,It's not there.
09x22,Unknown,"You learn Victoria has it in Germany, but Jeanette intercepts it, throws it in Central Park Lake."
09x22,Unknown,"It's a nice day for a swim, so what the heck?"
09x22,Unknown,"You dive in, scoop it up, make"
09x22,Unknown,it home in time for
09x22,Unknown,Jeopardy!
09x22,Unknown,Ease to the pease. Happy wedding.
09x22,Unknown,You're seriously questioning our wedding vows?

09x22,Unknown,"We're Marshmallow and Lilypad, b*tch."
09x22,Unknown,"Okay, I'll give you this."
09x22,Unknown,Your little pre-wedding wedding out by the tree... you said some very sweet stuff.
09x22,Unknown,"Hell, Ted even cried."

09x22,Unknown,Ted.
09x22,Unknown,"But later, at the actual wedding..."
09x22,Unknown,"Lily Aldrin, I vow to be there for you in sickness and in health."
09x22,Unknown,"Hate to tell you, Lilypad, but Marshall has since confessed to me that en route to your honeymoon..."
09x22,(retching),"Oh. Oh, God."
09x22,Unknown,(snoring)
09x22,Unknown,You son of a beech. You son of a beech.
09x22,Unknown,Do you deny it?
09x22,Unknown,"Lily, you know I'm not a vomit guy, and I just thought I should give you your space."
09x22,Unknown,Like a dying cat.
09x22,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, that saves it."
09x22,Unknown,I'm so sorry I let you down.
09x22,Unknown,"Hang on there, Marshmallow."
09x22,Unknown,Remember when the blushing bride said...
09x22,Unknown,I vow to honor and respect you.
09x22,Unknown,Maybe she was blushing because she was lying her ass off.
09x22,Unknown,Not two months later...
09x22,Unknown,Shh. Okay. Okay.
09x22,Unknown,"Hey, not cool!"
09x22,Unknown,You will not take a picture of my husband like that!
09x22,Unknown,(laughter)
09x22,Unknown,(camera clicks)
09x22,Unknown,You took part
09x22,Unknown,in the bearded Wonder Woman incident of 2007?
09x22,Unknown,"Lily, that photo got all over Friendster and Myspace and... man, 2007 was a long time ago."
09x22,Unknown,"Ted, I can't believe how much trouble you went through to get this for me."
09x22,Unknown,It really wasn't that much trouble.
09x22,Unknown,"Yes, it was."
09x22,Unknown,You always go big for me.
09x22,Unknown,Not as big as Barney.
09x22,Unknown,Canadian rehearsal dinner on ice-- big.
09x22,Unknown,The way he proposed-- huge.
09x22,Unknown,"Yeah, but think about it."
09x22,Unknown,"Those are the most loving things that Barney has ever done for me, and they're all based on lies."
09x22,Unknown,Right down to taking credit for this locket.
09x22,Unknown,That's not fair.
09x22,Unknown,I told Barney to take credit for it.
09x22,Unknown,Which he did without blinking an eye.
09x22,Unknown,Because lying is second nature to Barney.
09x22,Unknown,Everything's legendary.
09x22,Unknown,"You know what ""legendary"" means?"
09x22,Unknown,Not real.
09x22,Unknown,"I mean, the man's initials are ""B.S."""
09x22,Unknown,"If it helps, I'm pretty sure Barney Stinson's a fake name."
09x22,Unknown,I'm kidding.
09x22,Unknown,"You're the one who always comes through for me, Ted."
09x22,Unknown,The one who's there for me.
09x22,Unknown,Maybe I'm making a mistake.
09x22,Unknown,Wait. What-what are you saying?
09x22,Unknown,Maybe I should be marrying you.
09x22,Unknown,Wait. I know one vow we kept.
09x22,Unknown,I vow to make you breakfast in bed every Sunday morning.
09x22,Unknown,Really? You still do that?
09x22,Unknown,Absolutely.
09x22,Unknown,(baby crying)
09x22,MARSHALL,Heads up!
09x22,Unknown,Oh! No cream cheese?
09x22,Unknown,Oh.
09x22,Unknown,Oh!
09x22,Unknown,You feed her like Sloth from
09x22,Unknown,Goonies.
09x22,Unknown,So the magic's still there.
09x22,Unknown,"Well, here's one you definitely didn't keep."
09x22,Unknown,I vow to keep the romantic spark alive.
09x22,Unknown,And how is that going for you these days?
09x22,MARSHALL,Are you watching Marvin?
09x22,Unknown,I'm trimming my nose hair.
09x22,LILY,I'm dumping out.
09x22,Unknown,"I watched him all morning, Lily."
09x22,Unknown,I need a break.
09x22,Unknown,"I don't control when my deuces happen, Marshall."
09x22,Unknown,Deuces are wild!
09x22,Unknown,(laughing)
09x22,Unknown,"Ted, I should be with you."
09x22,Unknown,There it was-- the words
09x22,Unknown,"that some deep, dark part of me"
09x22,Unknown,always wanted to hear.
09x22,Unknown,But it's funny.
09x22,Unknown,Once you actually hear those words out loud...
09x22,Unknown,I don't want to hear that.
09x22,Unknown,We should get out of here.
09x22,Unknown,You and me right now. We'll...
09x22,Unknown,We'll move to Chicago. W-We'll start a new life.
09x22,Unknown,"It'll-it'll be painful at first, but, hell, I can root for the Blackhawks."
09x22,Unknown,Stop! Stop!
09x22,Unknown,You're just saying this because you're scared.
09x22,Unknown,I am not your future. Barney is.
09x22,Unknown,Shouldn't I be with the guy who finds me my locket?
09x22,Unknown,The guy who steals me the blue French horn.
09x22,Unknown,"I mean, look me in the eye and tell me, why shouldn't I be with that guy?"
09x22,Unknown,Because I'm not that guy anymore.
09x22,Unknown,Then why did you work so hard to find me my locket?
09x22,Unknown,It... it was a wedding gift.
09x22,Unknown,"Ted, stop it, okay? I know you better than that."
09x22,Unknown,This is more than a wedding gift.
09x22,Unknown,Maybe it started out that way. Maybe some part of me thought...
09x22,Unknown,That you still loved me.
09x22,Unknown,Maybe.
09x22,Unknown,But the truth is...
09x22,Unknown,I don't love you like that anymore.
09x22,Unknown,And you don't love me.
09x22,Unknown,You love Barney.
09x22,Unknown,"And if you think I would ever be part of screwing that up, then maybe you don't know me at all, Robin."
09x22,Unknown,(groans)
09x22,Unknown,I... I can't shake it.
09x22,Unknown,I-I can't shake this feeling that nothing about me and Barney makes any sense.
09x22,Unknown,But love doesn't make sense.
09x22,Unknown,"I mean, you can't logic your way into or out of it."
09x22,Unknown,"Love is totally nonsensical, but we have to keep doing it or else we're lost and-and love is dead and humanity should just pack it in."
09x22,Unknown,Because love is the best thing we do.
09x22,Unknown,"Look, I know that sounds cheesy, but it's-it's just true."
09x22,Unknown,"You love Barney, and-and he loves you."
09x22,Unknown,And that doesn't have to make sense to make sense.
09x22,Unknown,Remember back when you had never even seen me pee?
09x22,Unknown,Yeah. Yeah.
09x22,Unknown,"Oh, sorry."
09x22,Unknown,We were so innocent then.
09x22,Unknown,So many dreams.
09x22,Unknown,Trying to work over here.
09x22,Unknown,"Bright, shimmering future ahead."
09x22,Unknown,Now we're basically a couple of wild animals grunting at each other to throw some toilet paper through the crack in the bathroom door.
09x22,Unknown,"Baby, let's be honest."
09x22,Unknown,"At this point, that door is wide open."
09x22,Unknown,You know what you should use the next time you run out of toilet paper? Your wedding vows.
09x22,Unknown,"'Cause that's all your marriage has been, one long six-year wipe after that double-flusher of a wedding."
09x22,Unknown,Stinson out!
09x22,Unknown,You okay?
09x22,Unknown,Yeah.
09x22,Unknown,You're right. I'm-I'm being insane.
09x22,Unknown,"Oh, come on, Robin."
09x22,Unknown,That's... accurate.
09x22,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x22,Unknown,We can't run away together.
09x22,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x22,Unknown,Of course not.
09x22,Unknown,So I'm just gonna run away alone!
09x22,Unknown,(panting)
09x22,Unknown,Damn it.
09x22,Unknown,(panting)
09x22,Unknown,(yelps) Whoa!
09x22,Unknown,And that's how Robin met your mother.
09x22,Unknown,"Wait, what are we doing here?"
09x22,Unknown,"Lily, our-our wedding vows, maybe they were just too perfect for real life."
09x22,Unknown,"Real life is messier than that, and... we're different people than we were in 2007."
09x22,Unknown,But that's okay.
09x22,Unknown,Maybe we just need some updated vows.
09x22,Unknown,"So I thought maybe before this place gets too busy, we could... borrow this altar for a minute."
09x22,Unknown,"Lily Aldrin, I vow to stop shouting stuff at you when you're dumping out."
09x22,Unknown,"You're the love of my life, and you deserve to make a deuce in peace."
09x22,Unknown,"I vow to stop pointing out every dog erection we see when we walk through the park, even though they are incredibly weird looking."
09x22,Unknown,"Oh, just don't point and screa,[/i] mMaybe it's Maybelline."""
09x22,Unknown,"Marshall Eriksen, I vow to always tell you when you have green stuff in your teeth."
09x22,Unknown,You have green stuff in your teeth.
09x22,Unknown,Oh.
09x22,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x22,Unknown,"I vow to always sit next to you and hug you, even if you're covered in vomit, whether it's yours or Marvin's or... in the case of what came to be known as Spew Year's Eve 1998-- my own. Sorry."
09x22,Unknown,I vow to stop getting so angry...
09x22,Unknown,"Ooh, I just thought of another one."
09x22,Unknown,...when you interrupt me.
09x22,Unknown,"Mine was to interrupt you less, so that's good."
09x22,Unknown,"I vow... to finally stop petitioning Paul McCartney to let Weird Al recor,[/i] dChicken Pot Pie"" to the tune o,[/i] fLive and Let Die."""

09x22,Unknown,I'll let it go.
09x22,Unknown,I vow... to cry less during this pregnancy.
09x22,Unknown,I vow to cry less during this Vikings season.
09x22,Unknown,"Mm, with that secondary, I wouldn't make that promise."
09x22,Unknown,I vow to keep at least 80% of these vows.
09x22,Unknown,That seems high.
09x22,Unknown,And I vow to keep updating them as we go.
09x22,Unknown,"Because one set of vows, it can't cover a lifetime of growing and changing with you, of raising children with you..."
09x22,Unknown,"...falling more and more in love with you every day, Lily Aldrin, which is what I vow to do for the rest of my life."
09x22,Unknown,Crap. I already broke my crying vow.
09x22,Unknown,I'll forgive you.
09x22,Unknown,I am so sorry. Are you okay? Oh...
09x22,Unknown,That was totally my fault.
09x22,Unknown,No. The bride is always right. It was my fault.
09x22,Unknown,Are you okay?
09x22,Unknown,I'm fine.
09x22,Unknown,Are you sure?
09x22,Unknown,Because you were sprinting from a church in a wedding dress.
09x22,Unknown,"And as a kid, I was a bit of a detective..."
09x22,(chuckles),so...
09x22,Unknown,"Um... to be honest, I'm-I'm wondering if this... whole getting married thing is something I can go through with."
09x22,Unknown,Oh.
09x22,Unknown,Wow.
09x22,Unknown,That's it?
09x22,Unknown,Aren't you supposed to talk me out of it?
09x22,Unknown,Tell me it's just cold feet? I'm-I'm being crazy?
09x22,Unknown,"Okay, during that fall, we did kind of get to second base with each other... and we'll always share that... but I don't really know you."
09x22,So... here's all I'll say,"when I'm overwhelmed, I force myself to do one simple thing before I have to make a decision: close my eyes and take three deep breaths."
09x22,Unknown,Three deep breaths. Mm-hmm.
09x22,Unknown,Sometimes even three deep breaths can change everything.
09x22,Unknown,(breathing deeply)
09x22,Unknown,Barney?
09x22,Unknown,"Hey, I've been looking for you. You okay?"
09x22,Unknown,Uh... yeah. I-I was just talking to the... the band about the... thing with the stuff.
09x22,Unknown,What are those?
09x22,Unknown,My vows.
09x22,Unknown,"I-I know it's bad luck to see the bride right before the ceremony, but I realized something."
09x22,Unknown,"Marshall and Lily have broken most of their wedding vows, but they're still the best couple I know."
09x22,Unknown,I think their biggest problem was that Marshall didn't tell Lily the truth.
09x22,Unknown,So...
09x22,Unknown,"I've decided to make only one vow to you, because it's the only one that really counts."
09x22,Unknown,Robin Scherbatsky...
09x22,Unknown,"...from this day forward, I am always gonna be honest with you."
09x22,Unknown,'Cause I love you.
09x22,Unknown,I'll see you up there.
09x22,Unknown,Oh.
09x22,Unknown,Ted got that locket for you.
09x22,Unknown,He's the one you should thank.
09x22,Unknown,"Barney, wait."
09x22,Unknown,(Pachelbel's Canon in D playing)
09x22,(quietly),What is it?
09x22,Unknown,The cornflower blue tie.
09x22,Unknown,That's the one I should be wearing.
09x22,Unknown,It's right by my bed. Back in Manhattan.

09x23,Unknown,"Oh, hey."
09x23,Unknown,"Ted, what are you doing here?"
09x23,Unknown,Just having a drink.
09x23,Unknown,What are you doing in New York?
09x23,Unknown,Aren't you supposed to be in Chicago?
09x23,Unknown,No... Oh.

09x23,Unknown,What? What?
09x23,Unknown,I'm not moving to Chicago. Why?

09x23,Unknown,What are you... What are you doing? Calling her.
09x23,Unknown,Don't do this. Don't call her the next day.
09x23,Unknown,You're blowing this. Huh?
09x23,Unknown,"Three days. You wait three days, Ted. Oh, the three day rule is-is a childish, manipulative mind game."
09x23,Unknown,"But yeah, you wait three days."
09x23,Unknown,"H-Hey, it's Ted. Hi. Um, listen, do you ... do you want to have dinner tomorrow night?"
09x23,Unknown,Great.

09x23,Unknown,Same answer. Solid.

09x23,Unknown,He's fallen in love so many times now.
09x23,Unknown,Not like this.
09x23,Unknown,This is different.
09x23,Unknown,"Come on, go talk to her."
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, and it'll all be because of me."
09x23,Unknown,And I'll sing at your wedding. (laughs)
09x23,Unknown,"Y-You are gonna have a big wedding, right?"
09x23,Unknown,"What? No. Just be cool, lady. Damn."
09x23,Unknown,(sighs) And aren't big weddings kind of a young man's game?
09x23,Unknown,You don't have a big wedding in your 30s.
09x23,Unknown,"If I do ever get married, I'm keeping it simple."
09x23,Unknown,A hot air balloon?
09x23,Unknown,"Well, yeah. I mean, when you're getting married in a 17th-century castle in France and making your entrance on a stagecoach with six white horses, you kind of got to make a big exit. (chuckles)"
09x23,Unknown,How much are you spending on this?
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, like, a lot of money."
09x23,Unknown,Mm. All of my money.
09x23,Unknown,"Look, I know you guys have been traveling a lot, but you're coming, right?"
09x23,Unknown,Oh course. What... Duh.
09x23,Unknown,(short laugh)
09x23,Unknown,(quiet laugh)
09x23,Unknown,I'll get the next round.

09x23,Unknown,It's great. (laughs)
09x23,Unknown,Sounds great.
09x23,Unknown,"Hey. Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late."
09x23,Unknown,Can I talk to you for a minute?
09x23,Unknown,"Yeah, sure. Did you wire the down payment to the castle guy?"
09x23,Unknown,I got a castle guy.
09x23,Unknown,"I've got, like, three castle guys."
09x23,Unknown,"And a moat guy, so..."
09x23,Unknown,I didn't wire the payment because I don't think we can get married in September.
09x23,Unknown,"What-What, why? Because, when I do get married, I kind of want to fit in... my dress."
09x23,Unknown,Why wouldn't you f...
09x23,Unknown,No.
09x23,Unknown,Yeah.
09x23,Unknown,No. Yeah.
09x23,Unknown,"Yeah, yeah."
09x23,Unknown,Yeah. Whoa. (laughing)
09x23,Unknown,What's going on?
09x23,Unknown,She's getting a boob job.
09x23,Unknown,We just peeked in on Penny
09x23,Unknown,asleep in the baby room.
09x23,Unknown,It's adorable.
09x23,Unknown,"The whole place looks great, guys."
09x23,Unknown,But I can't believe you let Ted hang his jousting lance from the renaissance fair on your bedroom wall.
09x23,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x23,Unknown,Yeah.
09x23,Unknown,That's Ted's.
09x23,Unknown,"So, Marshall, how's your job going? Mm."
09x23,Unknown,My chair... is reasonably comfortable.
09x23,Unknown,For short periods of time.
09x23,Unknown,Marshall has decided to say only positive things about being back in corporate law.
09x23,Unknown,So you hate it?
09x23,Unknown,Much of what I do does not make me cry.
09x23,Unknown,But the job's only temporary.
09x23,Unknown,"Marshall was offered the judgeship once, and he turned it down for me."
09x23,Unknown,"So, karmically, that phone has to ring again."
09x23,Unknown,"And even if it doesn't, today, when my boss threw his egg salad sandwich at my face, some of it got into my mouth."
09x23,Unknown,And it was tasty.
09x23,Unknown,"Hey, what about you guys?"
09x23,Unknown,How was Argentina?
09x23,Unknown,Great. It was great.
09x23,Unknown,It was great. It was great.
09x23,Unknown,It was great. It
09x23,Unknown,was

09x23,Unknown,It was great.

09x23,Unknown,One more and I'll believe you.
09x23,Unknown,(sighs)
09x23,Unknown,(sighs)
09x23,Unknown,This is so not great.
09x23,Unknown,I'm sorry that I have to work while I'm here.
09x23,Unknown,It's called being on assignment.
09x23,Unknown,"Well, what about me? There's no Wi-Fi in this hotel."
09x23,Unknown,"How am I supposed to run a business, Robin, with no Wi-Fi?"
09x23,Unknown,"It's not a business, Barney, it's a blog, okay?"
09x23,Unknown,It is a lifestyle blog.
09x23,Unknown,"For the upscale, sophisticated urban gentleman, and it's never gonna take off if I can't post today's boner joke."
09x23,Unknown,I know I'm always traveling.
09x23,Unknown,"We both hate it when I'm gone, we both hate it when I drag you with me. Neither of us is happy."
09x23,Unknown,Is this just not working anymore?
09x23,Unknown,"Wait, w... What ""this""? This-this?"
09x23,Unknown,"If I gave you an out, right now... if there was an exit ramp right here at the three-year mark... would you take it?"
09x23,"Before I answer that, real quick",you want to get super drunk and have sex right now?
09x23,Unknown,Of course.
09x23,Unknown,"And then, one thing led to another."
09x23,Unknown,And then another.
09x23,Unknown,And then another after that.
09x23,Unknown,Oh. Oh.
09x23,Unknown,"And we kept drinking, and may have had a little... too much."
09x23,Unknown,Arigato.
09x23,Unknown,"Wow, these rooms all look the same, even when you're sober."
09x23,Unknown,You're sober?
09x23,Unknown,"So, um... about what we discussed last night."
09x23,Unknown,How do you feel?
09x23,Unknown,"I love you, Robin."
09x23,Unknown,"And when we got married, I made a vow that I would always tell you the truth."
09x23,Unknown,We got divorced.
09x23,Unknown,I can't believe you got divorced without telling us.
09x23,Unknown,This is my mom and dad all over again.
09x23,Unknown,"Barney, if you start brewing your own beer now and nail my prom date, so help me..."
09x23,Unknown,"Years too late on one of those, Teddy."
09x23,Unknown,"Guys, it's okay."
09x23,Unknown,This isn't a failed marriage.
09x23,Unknown,It's a very successful marriage that happened to only last three years.
09x23,Unknown,You both want this?
09x23,Unknown,For real?
09x23,Unknown,We do.
09x23,Unknown,For real.
09x23,Unknown,"Lily, you okay?"
09x23,Unknown,Of course I'm not okay.
09x23,Unknown,This ruins everything.
09x23,Unknown,"Now we have to choose sides, and obviously we're gonna choose Robin, but Barney has his moments."
09x23,MARSHALL,I really liked the boner joke of the day.
09x23,Unknown,"Look, you guys do not need to pick sides."
09x23,Unknown,Nothing has to change.
09x23,Unknown,"No. We've already broken up before and we've stayed friends, remember?"
09x23,Unknown,As long as you promise me this won't mean we stop hanging out.
09x23,Unknown,Okay.
09x23,Unknown,"I'm serious. I know, but, I mean, we hardly hang out anymore anyway."
09x23,Unknown,"They live in the suburbs now, and you two are about to have baby number three."
09x23,Unknown,Please. You're so obvious.
09x23,Unknown,"Your gals are back up to a full C-cup, and you've been sipping her drink all night long."
09x23,Unknown,We didn't want to announce anything till we knew for sure.
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh, Lily!"
09x23,Unknown,"That's amazing! Oh, congratulations!"
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, my God. Wait, see?"
09x23,Unknown,"This, right here, this is why we can't fall out of each other's lives."
09x23,Unknown,We have to be here for the big moments.
09x23,Unknown,"Just promise me, no matter what, we will always be there for the big moments."
09x23,Unknown,I-I promise. We'll-we'll always be there for the big moments.
09x23,Unknown,Mm. See?
09x23,Unknown,It's like this whole divorce thing never happened.
09x23,Unknown,(crying)
09x23,Unknown,I...
09x23,Unknown,"Hey. Hi, sweetie."
09x23,Unknown,How was work?
09x23,Unknown,"My-my boss only called me three words that meant ""vag*na"" today."
09x23,Unknown,How are the kids? Asleep.
09x23,Unknown,"Good. This is working, right?"
09x23,Unknown,Marvin and Daisy sharing a room together? It's not too cramped?
09x23,Unknown,"And then when the next one arrives, we'll just put her crib... in the shower."
09x23,Unknown,It's the perfect size. It'll save time on cleanups...
09x23,Unknown,Let's move somewhere bigger.
09x23,Unknown,"Yes. Oh, thank God."
09x23,Unknown,"I mean... You know, don't get me wrong. I love this apartment."
09x23,Unknown,How do you say good-bye to so many special memories?
09x23,Unknown,Cock-a-mouse! We have to move!
09x23,Unknown,(dance music playing)
09x23,Unknown,(laughs)
09x23,Unknown,"Hey, Marshall. Robin!"
09x23,Unknown,"Hey, I'm so glad you're here. It's-it's been forever."
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, hey. Hey."
09x23,Unknown,Where's your... where's your costume?
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, uh, it's been a crazy week at work so no time to go shopping."
09x23,Unknown,"Uh, well, who are you supposed to be?"
09x23,Unknown,"Okay, I want to make it clear this is not my idea."
09x23,Unknown,I'm Captain Ahab.
09x23,Unknown,Why is it bad if it was your idea?
09x23,Unknown,"Robin, you made it! A white whale. Got it. (chuckles)"
09x23,Unknown,Aw. Hi. Hi.
09x23,Unknown,"Yeah, I figured, people are thinkin' it. Might as well steer into the skid, right?"
09x23,Unknown,Where's your costume?
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, you know, I've just been so..."
09x23,Unknown,(squealing)
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, my God, Marshall!"
09x23,Unknown,Guess whose digits I just scored?
09x23,Unknown,The slutty police officer's... tax attorney.
09x23,Unknown,"Hey, Robin!"
09x23,Unknown,Hey. Didn't see you there.
09x23,Unknown,(chuckling nervously)
09x23,Unknown,Saved it.
09x23,Unknown,"Sorry, I got to pee."
09x23,Unknown,I-I'll be back in... an hour.
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, man."
09x23,Unknown,Is Ted still wearing his hanging chad costume?
09x23,Unknown,How old is that thing? It's gone from played out to charmingly retro and back six or seven times now.
09x23,Unknown,Kind of like Ted himself.
09x23,Unknown,Tonight it's working for him though.
09x23,Unknown,"How do you do this, Ted? How do you"
09x23,Unknown,sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up?
09x23,Unknown,"Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't gonna magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at..."
09x23,2,"43 in the morning, but... this seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know... sit and wait."
09x23,Unknown,"Um... uh, c-can you tell Lily I-I had to go?"
09x23,Unknown,I got to split.
09x23,Unknown,(sighs)
09x23,Unknown,"Speaking of splits, do you think I can do a split in midair like my boy David Lee Roth?"
09x23,Unknown,I know you can't.
09x23,Unknown,Challenge accepted.
09x23,Unknown,(exhales)
09x23,BARNEY,"Oh, my scrotum!"
09x23,Unknown,(sighs)
09x23,Unknown,I can't get out of this thing.
09x23,Unknown,I'm holding it.
09x23,Unknown,"Wait, are you leaving? Yeah, I got a big day tomorrow. I got to get some sleep."
09x23,Unknown,"No, you can't leave. This is a big moment."
09x23,Unknown,We're saying good-bye to the apartment.
09x23,Unknown,The whole g*ng has to be here.
09x23,Unknown,The g*ng?
09x23,Unknown,"Do you know who the g*ng is to me, Lily?"
09x23,Here's what the g*ng is,"the g*ng is a married couple who I never see anymore, about to have their third kid; it's my ex-husband, hitting on slutty cops right in front of me; and it's the guy I probably should have ended up with with the beautiful mother of his child."
09x23,Unknown,"I mean, who in their right mind would call that group of people ""the g*ng""?"
09x23,Unknown,Oh...
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, oh, so... so what?"
09x23,Unknown,This is all just over then?
09x23,Unknown,Our whole friendship is just over?
09x23,Unknown,"No. No, of course not. Look, we'll... we'll always be friends. It's just... never gonna be how it was."
09x23,Unknown,It can't be.
09x23,Unknown,And that doesn't have to be a sad thing.
09x23,Unknown,There-There's so much wonderful stuff happening in all of our lives right now.
09x23,Unknown,"Look, more than enough to be grateful for."
09x23,Unknown,"But the five of us hanging out at MacLaren's, being young and stupid..."
09x23,Unknown,(sighs) that's just not one of those things.
09x23,Unknown,That part's over.
09x23,Unknown,(sighs)
09x23,Unknown,I got to go.
09x23,Unknown,"Good night, Lily."
09x23,Unknown,Good night.
09x23,Unknown,(shuddering sigh)
09x23,Unknown,Marshall's almost here.
09x23,Unknown,"Yes! Look at us, hanging out again. This is amazing."
09x23,Unknown,This is awesome!
09x23,Unknown,This is... (roaring)
09x23,(laughing),Okay.
09x23,Unknown,"Just settle down, buddy. No!"
09x23,Unknown,Settling down is for losers with kids who never go out anymore.
09x23,Unknown,"I am in charge tonight, and the earliest I am allowing anyone to go home is..."
09x23,2,00 a.m.
09x23,10,00 p.m.
09x23,9,45.
09x23,3,00 a.m.
09x23,Unknown,"Guys, tonight is gonna be legen... wait for it..."
09x23,Unknown,"If I leave now, I could put the kids to bed."
09x23,Unknown,I'll get the check.
09x23,Unknown,..dary!
09x23,Unknown,Legendary!
09x23,Unknown,"Guys, the g*ng is back!"
09x23,Unknown,We're back!
09x23,Unknown,"(sputtering, shouting)"
09x23,Unknown,All of us except for Robin.
09x23,Unknown,We never see her anymore.
09x23,"Okay, in addition to you guys not going home before 4","00 a.m.-- yes, it's up to 4:00 now... new rule: anytime anyone talks about something sad, we stay out an extra hour."
09x23,Unknown,We said we'd always be there for the big moments.
09x23,5,"00 a.m. To be fair, tonight's just us hanging out until 10:00 p.m., tops."
09x23,Unknown,It's not a big moment.
09x23,BARNEY,"Um, yes, it is. Um, no, it's not."
09x23,Unknown,"Um, yes, it is. Um... no, it's not."
09x23,Unknown,"Um, yes, it is."
09x23,Unknown,I got a phone call today.
09x23,Unknown,"A judge in Queens is retiring, so..."
09x23,Unknown,I'm gonna be a judge.
09x23,Unknown,(gasps)
09x23,Unknown,(shouting)
09x23,Unknown,Yes! Yes!
09x23,Unknown,(laughing)
09x23,Unknown,Judge Eriksen!
09x23,Unknown,Yeah!
09x23,Unknown,(chuckling) One more.
09x23,Unknown,I told you the phone would ring. You deserve this.
09x23,Unknown,"Thanks, Lily."
09x23,"I love you, Marshmallow. TED",Oh.
09x23,1,45 a.m.
09x23,Unknown,"Well, you were right, Barney, this night was, in fact, legendary, but..."
09x23,Unknown,I know what you're gonna say and I agree.
09x23,Unknown,We're going to Vegas!
09x23,TED,I will be awakened by screaming children in less than...
09x23,(crying),four-and-a-half hours.
09x23,BARNEY,You're staying.
09x23,Unknown,I'm going.
09x23,Unknown,"Judge Fudge, your very first ruling?"
09x23,(deep voice),He stays.
09x23,Unknown,Hey! See?
09x23,Unknown,Tonight is about celebrating our enduring bond as friends.
09x23,Unknown,"Nay, family. Because that's what we are, Ted."
09x23,Unknown,We are fa...
09x23,Unknown,"Okay, fun night, guys. Keep in touch."
09x23,Unknown,"Damn it, Barney."
09x23,Unknown,(choking)
09x23,(strained),Crushing... windpipe.
09x23,Unknown,You're lucky that's the only pipe I'm crushing.
09x23,Unknown,Aah! That woman is half your age.
09x23,Unknown,"Haven't you changed, even a little?"
09x23,Unknown,No. I haven't.
09x23,Unknown,"Look, I know there was a time when it seemed like I was capable of going the distance, but... if it wasn't gonna happen with Robin, then it's just not gonna happen with anyone."
09x23,Unknown,"I am never gonna be a guy who meets a girl and, from the first time I see her, I'm just like, ""You are the love of my life."
09x23,Unknown,"""Everything I have and everything I am is yours forever."""
09x23,Unknown,Really?
09x23,Unknown,"No, I'm just making a point. Move it along."
09x23,Unknown,That's not me.
09x23,Unknown,"I'm the guy who straightens his tie, says something dirty, high-fives himself and then goes and talks to that girl over there."
09x23,Unknown,That's me.
09x23,Unknown,Can I please... just be me?
09x23,Unknown,Judge Fudge?
09x23,Unknown,I'll allow it.
09x23,Unknown,Then I'll a-plow it. Self-five.
09x23,Unknown,Stinson out.
09x23,Unknown,(rock music playing)
09x23,Unknown,(cheering)
09x23,Unknown,Oh!
09x23,(whoops) MARSHALL,"Hey, so are you guys ever gonna tie the knot or are you... are you just comfortable living in sin?"
09x23,Unknown,Someone's gotten a bit... judge-y. Oh!
09x23,Sustained. THE MOTHER,Yeah.
09x23,Unknown,"We'll get around to it. It's just, you know, with life and jobs and kids."
09x23,Unknown,"Plus, this one's still insisting on getting married in a French castle."
09x23,Unknown,"I'd get married tomorrow in a White Castle, but this guy needs more ""wow factor."""
09x23,Unknown,You're all the wow factor I need.
09x23,BARNEY,Aw!
09x23,Unknown,(mimics retching)
09x23,Unknown,Glad someone can be happy on the day of a tragedy.
09x23,LILY,"Aw, Barney, you know this is all fake, right?"
09x23,Unknown,That robot's not really dead.
09x23,Unknown,(laughter)
09x23,Unknown,"I'm not talking about the robot, Lily. Everyone, stop having fun! I'm about to tell a sad story!"
09x23,Unknown,"Guys, remember back in 2010 when I achieved a perfect week?"
09x23,Unknown,"Seven girls in seven nights, sure."
09x23,BARNEY,"Well, recently, I decided to attempt... a perfect month."
09x23,Unknown,I put together a brand-new playbook.
09x23,Unknown,"No, I can't hear this. This is just too sad."
09x23,Unknown,But I haven't gotten to the sad part yet.
09x23,Unknown,You're in your 40s and you have a playbook.
09x23,Unknown,That's the sad part.
09x23,Unknown,Lily... just...
09x23,Unknown,Okay?
09x23,Unknown,"So I put together a brand-new playbook, filled with plays I'd never tried before, like..."
09x23,Unknown,"...where, as in the '80s classic, I magically"
09x23,Unknown,come
09x23,Unknown,"to life, if you know what I mean."
09x23,Unknown,...where I wait till a girl mentions something she likes.
09x23,Unknown,"God, I love nachos."
09x23,Unknown,Thank you.
09x23,Unknown,Allow me to introduce myself.
09x23,Unknown,"My name is Jim, Jim Nacho."
09x23,Unknown,Inventor of the nacho.
09x23,Unknown,So... did you get a perfect month?
09x23,Unknown,Yes.
09x23,Unknown,Then why are you so upset?
09x23,Unknown,"That last girl, number 31..."
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, that's a pretty name. What is that, French?"
09x23,Unknown,...she's pregnant.
09x23,Unknown,"Wait, you're messing with us, right?"
09x23,Unknown,You didn't really get a girl pregnant?
09x23,Unknown,It's real.
09x23,Unknown,She's pregnant.
09x23,Unknown,"Kinda puts an asterisk, on the whole perfect month thing, huh?"
09x23,Unknown,"Barney, are you okay?"
09x23,Unknown,"Ah, Jim Nantz."
09x23,Unknown,Thank goodness. You're always here for me in times of trouble.
09x23,Unknown,What should I do?
09x23,Unknown,"You're on your own this time, bro."
09x23,Unknown,"Congratulations, Papa."
09x23,Unknown,Stop it. This is a disaster.
09x23,Unknown,Why?
09x23,Unknown,Why? Because I'm too old.
09x23,Unknown,"I was about to enter my golden years, my Clooney years, my daddy issues years, where I don't just remind messed-up girls of their dads because I'm emotionally distant."
09x23,Unknown,I freaking look like their dads. That's the dream.
09x23,Unknown,My life is over.
09x23,Unknown,So where are you guys registered?
09x23,Unknown,"Another fun fact about the Goliath National Bank building,"
09x23,Unknown,the sleek but historical facade has been described by
09x23,Unknown,Architecture Vision Monthly
09x23,Unknown,"as ""modern classicism."""
09x23,Unknown,I can see that.
09x23,Unknown,Mm-hmm. Any questions from the group?
09x23,Unknown,I have a question.
09x23,Unknown,What happened to the building that used to be here?
09x23,Unknown,It was way nicer.
09x23,Unknown,Robin!
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, my God!"
09x23,Unknown,What are you doing here?
09x23,Unknown,I thought you were in...
09x23,Unknown,"Greece, uh, Morocco, Moscow."
09x23,Unknown,"Yeah, World Wide News keeps me pretty busy."
09x23,Unknown,And pretty famous.
09x23,Unknown,"I mean, you're everywhere."
09x23,Unknown,I am not everywhere. The...
09x23,Unknown,"Okay, I'm some places."
09x23,(laughs),"Hi, Penny."
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh, I haven't seen you in forever."
09x23,Unknown,"I like you, bus lady. Oh, I like you, too."
09x23,Unknown,Never call me that again.
09x23,Unknown,(giggles)
09x23,Unknown,And that was it.
09x23,Unknown,Wow. Hm.
09x23,Unknown,A genuine Scherbatsky sighting out in nature.
09x23,Unknown,"At this point, that's like seeing Sasquatch."
09x23,Unknown,"No, Sasquatch is a warm and affectionate creature."
09x23,Unknown,"At this point, Robin's more like the yeti... cold and aloof."
09x23,Unknown,"Hey, Ted."
09x23,Unknown,Ask me if the Abominable Snowman called.
09x23,Unknown,Has the Abominable Snowman called?
09x23,Unknown,Not yeti.
09x23,Unknown,Here we are again.
09x23,Unknown,"Another big moment for us, and Robin's missing it."
09x23,MARSHALL,"I know, baby."
09x23,Unknown,"I mean, the birth of her ex-husband's love child is a bit of a stretch... but I know, baby."
09x23,Unknown,(sighs)
09x23,Unknown,Well?
09x23,Unknown,"It was... crazy in there, but..."
09x23,Unknown,"I threw up, and now I feel better."
09x23,Unknown,Where were you?
09x23,Unknown,"In the can. I knew I was gonna urp, so I put this on over my suit."
09x23,Unknown,Number 31 won't let me in the delivery room.
09x23,Unknown,We're gonna need a name eventually.
09x23,Unknown,Mr. Stinson?
09x23,Unknown,Yes? Congratulations.
09x23,Unknown,Congratulations because the blood test came back and I'm not the father?!
09x23,Unknown,Happy Not a Father's Day!
09x23,Unknown,No. Congratulations.
09x23,Unknown,It's a girl.
09x23,Unknown,Would you like to meet her?
09x23,Unknown,"Nah, I'm good."
09x23,Unknown,"I don't... Oh, just go meet your daughter!"
09x23,Unknown,This is Ellie.
09x23,Unknown,I'll give you guys a minute.
09x23,Unknown,♪
09x23,Unknown,You are the love of my life.
09x23,Unknown,(trembling breath)
09x23,Unknown,Everything I have... and everything I am...
09x23,Unknown,...is yours.
09x23,Unknown,(gasping breath)
09x23,Unknown,Forever.
09x23,Unknown,What?
09x23,Unknown,Do I have stuff in my teeth?
09x23,Unknown,Give me your engagement ring back.
09x23,Unknown,Just because I have stuff in my teeth?
09x23,Unknown,We-we can work through this.
09x23,(laughs),Just give it back.
09x23,Unknown,(clears throat)
09x23,Unknown,"If you don't get married in that time, you have to re-propose."
09x23,Unknown,Will you...
09x23,Unknown,"Yes. Yes, you silly man."
09x23,Unknown,Let me finish.
09x23,Unknown,Will you...
09x23,Unknown,Yes! Sorry.
09x23,Unknown,Yes.
09x23,Unknown,Will y...
09x23,Unknown,Will you marry me... on Thursday?
09x23,Unknown,I called your office... you got nothing on Thursday.
09x23,Unknown,Will you marry me on Thursday?
09x23,Unknown,Yes.
09x23,Unknown,(laughs)
09x23,Unknown,(groans)
09x23,Unknown,Same ring.
09x23,Unknown,(laughs)
09x23,Unknown,I can't believe it.
09x23,Unknown,It's Ted Mosby's wedding day!
09x23,Unknown,Yes! After only seven years and two kids.
09x23,Unknown,"Guys, am I rushing into this?"
09x23,Unknown,Whoa.
09x23,Unknown,"Oh, buddy, are you okay?"
09x23,Unknown,So tired.
09x23,Unknown,Baby no sleepy.
09x23,Unknown,Barney dying.
09x23,Unknown,"Well, we're staying out till"
09x23,3,00 a.m. tonight.
09x23,9,45!
09x23,Unknown,"Seriously, though, I am so proud of you."
09x23,Unknown,Not that you're a dad.
09x23,Unknown,It's like you're a totally different pers... Whoa!
09x23,Unknown,And... we're back.
09x23,Unknown,Hey.
09x23,Unknown,Hi. What to join us for sh*ts?
09x23,(chuckles),sh*ts?
09x23,Unknown,Before lunch on a Thursday?
09x23,Unknown,It's like you're
09x23,Unknown,trying

09x23,Unknown,"You young ladies need to go home, put on some decent clothes and take a good hard look at your lives. Get!"
09x23,Unknown,Call your parents... they're probably worried sick.
09x23,Unknown,I have officially seen everything.
09x23,Unknown,Not everything.
09x23,Unknown,Hi. Hi.
09x23,Unknown,"I-I know I've... missed a couple lately, but... we said we'd always be there for the big moments."

09x23,Unknown,", dummy, you had a kid."
09x23,Unknown,"Congrats. Right, yeah."
09x23,Unknown,Thanks. A kid.

09x23,Unknown,You'll be calling me Fudge Supreme.
09x23,Unknown,(others chuckling)
09x23,Unknown,The man of the hour.
09x23,Unknown,Yeah.
09x23,Unknown,You RSVP'd no.

09x23,Unknown,"Hear, hear."
09x23,OTHERS,"Hear, hear."
09x23,Unknown,Aunt Lily wasn't wrong.
09x23,Unknown,"It was at times a long, difficult road."
09x23,Unknown,"But I'm glad it was long and difficult, because if I hadn't gone through hell to get there, the lesson might not have been as clear."
09x23,Unknown,"You see, kids, right from the moment I met your mom, I knew..."
09x23,Unknown,"I have to love this woman as much as I can for as long as I can, and I can never stop loving her, not even for a second."
09x23,"I carried that lesson with me through every stupid fight we ever had, every 5","00 a.m. Christmas morning, every sleepy Sunday afternoon, through every speed bump."
09x23,Unknown,"Every pang of jealousy or boredom or uncertainty that came our way, I carried that lesson with me."
09x23,Unknown,And I carried it with me when she got sick.
09x23,Unknown,"Even then, in what can only be called the worst of times, all I could do was thank God, thank every god there is, or ever was, or will be, and the whole universe, and anyone else I can possibly thank..."
09x23,Unknown,♪ Will I see you tonight?

09x23,Unknown,Let's look at the facts here.
09x23,Unknown,You made us sit down and listen to this story about how you met mom.
09x23,Unknown,Yet mom's hardly in the story. No.
09x23,Unknown,This is a story about how you're totally in love with Aunt Robin.
09x23,Unknown,"And you're thinking about asking her out, and you want to know if we're okay with it."
09x23,Unknown,I can't believe this.
09x23,Unknown,"I kept this story short and to the point, and you guys still missed it."
09x23,Unknown,The point of the story is that...

09x23,Unknown,"No, I don't."
09x23,Unknown,"Yes, you do."

09x24,Unknown,"I moved here for this on-air reporter job at Metro News 1 thinking it was gonna be my big break, only to find out that our viewership mostly consists of DMV waiting rooms and people plugging in their TV for the first time."
09x24,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x24,Unknown,"To top it all off, I have no friends."
09x24,Unknown,Um... wrong.

09x24,Unknown,There's only one way I'd let either of you have sex with her.
09x24,Unknown,(gasps)
09x24,Unknown,Not that. It's never that.
09x24,Unknown,I really want this girl to stay a part of our lives.
09x24,Unknown,So the only way you're allowed to hook up with her... is if you marry her.

09x24,Unknown,"Come on, go talk to her."
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, and it'll all be because of me."
09x24,Unknown,And I'll sing at your wedding. (laughs)
09x24,Unknown,"Y-You are gonna have a big wedding, right?"
09x24,Unknown,"What? No. Just be cool, lady. Damn."
09x24,Unknown,(sighs) And aren't big weddings kind of a young man's game?
09x24,Unknown,You don't have a big wedding in your 30s.
09x24,Unknown,"If I do ever get married, I'm keeping it simple."
09x24,Unknown,A hot air balloon?
09x24,Unknown,"Well, yeah. I mean, when you're getting married in a 17th-century castle in France and making your entrance on a stagecoach with six white horses, you kind of got to make a big exit. (chuckles)"
09x24,Unknown,How much are you spending on this?
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, like, a lot of money."
09x24,Unknown,Mm. All of my money.
09x24,Unknown,"Look, I know you guys have been traveling a lot, but you're coming, right?"
09x24,Unknown,Oh course. What... Duh.
09x24,Unknown,(short laugh)
09x24,Unknown,(quiet laugh)
09x24,Unknown,I'll get the next round.
09x24,Unknown,Thanks.
09x24,Unknown,"I'd offer, but..."
09x24,Unknown,Castle.
09x24,Unknown,Yeah.
09x24,Unknown,"So, how you guys doing?"
09x24,Unknown,"I mean, Robin's really taking off at work, huh?"
09x24,Unknown,"It's like, ""Robin Scherbatsky, World Wide News, Caracas."""
09x24,Unknown,"""Robin Scherbatsky, World Wide News, St. Petersburg."""
09x24,Unknown,"""Robin Scherbatsky, World Wide News, anywhere but New York, apparently."" (laughs)"
09x24,Unknown,But it's great.
09x24,Unknown,"Uh, it's makes things super difficult for us, but it's great. It's great."
09x24,Unknown,It's great. It's great.
09x24,Unknown,One more and I'll believe you.
09x24,Unknown,It's great. (laughs)
09x24,Unknown,Sounds great.
09x24,Unknown,"Hey. Hi, hi. Sorry I'm late."
09x24,Unknown,Can I talk to you for a minute?
09x24,Unknown,"Yeah, sure. Did you wire the down payment to the castle guy?"
09x24,Unknown,I got a castle guy.
09x24,Unknown,"I've got, like, three castle guys."
09x24,Unknown,"And a moat guy, so..."
09x24,Unknown,I didn't wire the payment because I don't think we can get married in September.
09x24,Unknown,"What-What, why? Because, when I do get married, I kind of want to fit in... my dress."
09x24,Unknown,Why wouldn't you f...
09x24,Unknown,No.
09x24,Unknown,Yeah.
09x24,Unknown,No. Yeah.
09x24,Unknown,"Yeah, yeah."
09x24,Unknown,Yeah. Whoa. (laughing)
09x24,Unknown,What's going on?
09x24,Unknown,She's getting a boob job.
09x24,Unknown,We just peeked in on Penny
09x24,Unknown,asleep in the baby room.
09x24,Unknown,It's adorable.
09x24,Unknown,"The whole place looks great, guys."
09x24,Unknown,But I can't believe you let Ted hang his jousting lance from the renaissance fair on your bedroom wall.
09x24,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x24,Unknown,Yeah.
09x24,Unknown,That's Ted's.
09x24,Unknown,"So, Marshall, how's your job going? Mm."
09x24,Unknown,My chair... is reasonably comfortable.
09x24,Unknown,For short periods of time.
09x24,Unknown,Marshall has decided to say only positive things about being back in corporate law.
09x24,Unknown,So you hate it?
09x24,Unknown,Much of what I do does not make me cry.
09x24,Unknown,But the job's only temporary.
09x24,Unknown,"Marshall was offered the judgeship once, and he turned it down for me."
09x24,Unknown,"So, karmically, that phone has to ring again."
09x24,Unknown,"And even if it doesn't, today, when my boss threw his egg salad sandwich at my face, some of it got into my mouth."
09x24,Unknown,And it was tasty.
09x24,Unknown,"Hey, what about you guys?"
09x24,Unknown,How was Argentina?
09x24,Unknown,Great. It was great.
09x24,Unknown,It was great. It was great.
09x24,Unknown,It was great. It
09x24,Unknown,was
09x24,Unknown,great.
09x24,Unknown,It was great.
09x24,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x24,Unknown,One more and I'll believe you.
09x24,Unknown,(sighs)
09x24,Unknown,(sighs)
09x24,Unknown,This is so not great.
09x24,Unknown,I'm sorry that I have to work while I'm here.
09x24,Unknown,It's called being on assignment.
09x24,Unknown,"Well, what about me? There's no Wi-Fi in this hotel."
09x24,Unknown,"How am I supposed to run a business, Robin, with no Wi-Fi?"
09x24,Unknown,"It's not a business, Barney, it's a blog, okay?"
09x24,Unknown,It is a lifestyle blog.
09x24,Unknown,"For the upscale, sophisticated urban gentleman, and it's never gonna take off if I can't post today's boner joke."
09x24,Unknown,I know I'm always traveling.
09x24,Unknown,"We both hate it when I'm gone, we both hate it when I drag you with me. Neither of us is happy."
09x24,Unknown,Is this just not working anymore?
09x24,Unknown,"Wait, w... What ""this""? This-this?"
09x24,Unknown,"If I gave you an out, right now... if there was an exit ramp right here at the three-year mark... would you take it?"
09x24,"Before I answer that, real quick",you want to get super drunk and have sex right now?
09x24,Unknown,Of course.
09x24,Unknown,"And then, one thing led to another."
09x24,Unknown,And then another.
09x24,Unknown,And then another after that.
09x24,Unknown,Oh. Oh.
09x24,Unknown,"And we kept drinking, and may have had a little... too much."
09x24,Unknown,Arigato.
09x24,Unknown,"Wow, these rooms all look the same, even when you're sober."
09x24,Unknown,You're sober?
09x24,Unknown,"So, um... about what we discussed last night."
09x24,Unknown,How do you feel?
09x24,Unknown,"I love you, Robin."
09x24,Unknown,"And when we got married, I made a vow that I would always tell you the truth."
09x24,Unknown,We got divorced.
09x24,Unknown,I can't believe you got divorced without telling us.
09x24,Unknown,This is my mom and dad all over again.
09x24,Unknown,"Barney, if you start brewing your own beer now and nail my prom date, so help me..."
09x24,Unknown,"Years too late on one of those, Teddy."
09x24,Unknown,"Guys, it's okay."
09x24,Unknown,This isn't a failed marriage.
09x24,Unknown,It's a very successful marriage that happened to only last three years.
09x24,Unknown,You both want this?
09x24,Unknown,For real?
09x24,Unknown,We do.
09x24,Unknown,For real.
09x24,Unknown,"Lily, you okay?"
09x24,Unknown,Of course I'm not okay.
09x24,Unknown,This ruins everything.
09x24,Unknown,"Now we have to choose sides, and obviously we're gonna choose Robin, but Barney has his moments."
09x24,MARSHALL,I really liked the boner joke of the day.
09x24,Unknown,"Look, you guys do not need to pick sides."
09x24,Unknown,Nothing has to change.
09x24,Unknown,"No. We've already broken up before and we've stayed friends, remember?"
09x24,Unknown,As long as you promise me this won't mean we stop hanging out.
09x24,Unknown,Okay.
09x24,Unknown,"I'm serious. I know, but, I mean, we hardly hang out anymore anyway."
09x24,Unknown,"They live in the suburbs now, and you two are about to have baby number three."
09x24,Unknown,Please. You're so obvious.
09x24,Unknown,"Your gals are back up to a full C-cup, and you've been sipping her drink all night long."
09x24,Unknown,We didn't want to announce anything till we knew for sure.
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh, Lily!"
09x24,Unknown,"That's amazing! Oh, congratulations!"
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, my God. Wait, see?"
09x24,Unknown,"This, right here, this is why we can't fall out of each other's lives."
09x24,Unknown,We have to be here for the big moments.
09x24,Unknown,"Just promise me, no matter what, we will always be there for the big moments."
09x24,Unknown,I-I promise. We'll-we'll always be there for the big moments.
09x24,Unknown,Mm. See?
09x24,Unknown,It's like this whole divorce thing never happened.
09x24,Unknown,(crying)
09x24,Unknown,I...
09x24,Unknown,"Hey. Hi, sweetie."
09x24,Unknown,How was work?
09x24,Unknown,"My-my boss only called me three words that meant ""vag*na"" today."
09x24,Unknown,How are the kids? Asleep.
09x24,Unknown,"Good. This is working, right?"
09x24,Unknown,Marvin and Daisy sharing a room together? It's not too cramped?
09x24,Unknown,"And then when the next one arrives, we'll just put her crib... in the shower."
09x24,Unknown,It's the perfect size. It'll save time on cleanups...
09x24,Unknown,Let's move somewhere bigger.
09x24,Unknown,"Yes. Oh, thank God."
09x24,Unknown,"I mean... You know, don't get me wrong. I love this apartment."
09x24,Unknown,How do you say good-bye to so many special memories?
09x24,Unknown,Cock-a-mouse! We have to move!
09x24,Unknown,(dance music playing)
09x24,Unknown,(laughs)
09x24,Unknown,"Hey, Marshall. Robin!"
09x24,Unknown,"Hey, I'm so glad you're here. It's-it's been forever."
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, hey. Hey."
09x24,Unknown,Where's your... where's your costume?
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, uh, it's been a crazy week at work so no time to go shopping."
09x24,Unknown,"Uh, well, who are you supposed to be?"
09x24,Unknown,"Okay, I want to make it clear this is not my idea."
09x24,Unknown,I'm Captain Ahab.
09x24,Unknown,Why is it bad if it was your idea?
09x24,Unknown,"Robin, you made it! A white whale. Got it. (chuckles)"
09x24,Unknown,Aw. Hi. Hi.
09x24,Unknown,"Yeah, I figured, people are thinkin' it. Might as well steer into the skid, right?"
09x24,Unknown,Where's your costume?
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, you know, I've just been so..."
09x24,Unknown,(squealing)
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, my God, Marshall!"
09x24,Unknown,Guess whose digits I just scored?
09x24,Unknown,The slutty police officer's... tax attorney.
09x24,Unknown,"Hey, Robin!"
09x24,Unknown,Hey. Didn't see you there.
09x24,Unknown,(chuckling nervously)
09x24,Unknown,Saved it.
09x24,Unknown,"Sorry, I got to pee."
09x24,Unknown,I-I'll be back in... an hour.
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, man."
09x24,Unknown,Is Ted still wearing his hanging chad costume?
09x24,Unknown,How old is that thing? It's gone from played out to charmingly retro and back six or seven times now.
09x24,Unknown,Kind of like Ted himself.
09x24,Unknown,Tonight it's working for him though.
09x24,Unknown,"How do you do this, Ted? How do you"
09x24,Unknown,sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up?
09x24,Unknown,"Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't gonna magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at..."
09x24,2,"43 in the morning, but... this seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know... sit and wait."
09x24,Unknown,"Um... uh, c-can you tell Lily I-I had to go?"
09x24,Unknown,I got to split.
09x24,Unknown,(sighs)
09x24,Unknown,"Speaking of splits, do you think I can do a split in midair like my boy David Lee Roth?"
09x24,Unknown,I know you can't.
09x24,Unknown,Challenge accepted.
09x24,Unknown,(exhales)
09x24,BARNEY,"Oh, my scrotum!"
09x24,Unknown,(sighs)
09x24,Unknown,I can't get out of this thing.
09x24,Unknown,I'm holding it.
09x24,Unknown,"Wait, are you leaving? Yeah, I got a big day tomorrow. I got to get some sleep."
09x24,Unknown,"No, you can't leave. This is a big moment."
09x24,Unknown,We're saying good-bye to the apartment.
09x24,Unknown,The whole g*ng has to be here.
09x24,Unknown,The g*ng?
09x24,Unknown,"Do you know who the g*ng is to me, Lily?"
09x24,Here's what the g*ng is,"the g*ng is a married couple who I never see anymore, about to have their third kid; it's my ex-husband, hitting on slutty cops right in front of me; and it's the guy I probably should have ended up with with the beautiful mother of his child."
09x24,Unknown,"I mean, who in their right mind would call that group of people ""the g*ng""?"
09x24,Unknown,Oh...
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, oh, so... so what?"
09x24,Unknown,This is all just over then?
09x24,Unknown,Our whole friendship is just over?
09x24,Unknown,"No. No, of course not. Look, we'll... we'll always be friends. It's just... never gonna be how it was."
09x24,Unknown,It can't be.
09x24,Unknown,And that doesn't have to be a sad thing.
09x24,Unknown,There-There's so much wonderful stuff happening in all of our lives right now.
09x24,Unknown,"Look, more than enough to be grateful for."
09x24,Unknown,"But the five of us hanging out at MacLaren's, being young and stupid..."
09x24,Unknown,(sighs) that's just not one of those things.
09x24,Unknown,That part's over.
09x24,Unknown,(sighs)
09x24,Unknown,I got to go.
09x24,Unknown,"Good night, Lily."
09x24,Unknown,Good night.
09x24,Unknown,(shuddering sigh)
09x24,Unknown,Marshall's almost here.
09x24,Unknown,"Yes! Look at us, hanging out again. This is amazing."
09x24,Unknown,This is awesome!
09x24,Unknown,This is... (roaring)
09x24,(laughing),Okay.
09x24,Unknown,"Just settle down, buddy. No!"
09x24,Unknown,Settling down is for losers with kids who never go out anymore.
09x24,Unknown,"I am in charge tonight, and the earliest I am allowing anyone to go home is..."
09x24,2,00 a.m.
09x24,10,00 p.m.
09x24,9,45.
09x24,3,00 a.m.
09x24,Unknown,"Guys, tonight is gonna be legen... wait for it..."
09x24,Unknown,"If I leave now, I could put the kids to bed."
09x24,Unknown,I'll get the check.
09x24,Unknown,..dary!
09x24,Unknown,Legendary!
09x24,Unknown,"Guys, the g*ng is back!"
09x24,Unknown,We're back!
09x24,Unknown,"(sputtering, shouting)"
09x24,Unknown,All of us except for Robin.
09x24,Unknown,We never see her anymore.
09x24,"Okay, in addition to you guys not going home before 4","00 a.m.-- yes, it's up to 4:00 now... new rule: anytime anyone talks about something sad, we stay out an extra hour."
09x24,Unknown,We said we'd always be there for the big moments.
09x24,5,"00 a.m. To be fair, tonight's just us hanging out until 10:00 p.m., tops."
09x24,Unknown,It's not a big moment.
09x24,BARNEY,"Um, yes, it is. Um, no, it's not."
09x24,Unknown,"Um, yes, it is. Um... no, it's not."
09x24,Unknown,"Um, yes, it is."
09x24,Unknown,I got a phone call today.
09x24,Unknown,"A judge in Queens is retiring, so..."
09x24,Unknown,I'm gonna be a judge.
09x24,Unknown,(gasps)
09x24,Unknown,(shouting)
09x24,Unknown,Yes! Yes!
09x24,Unknown,(laughing)
09x24,Unknown,Judge Eriksen!
09x24,Unknown,Yeah!
09x24,Unknown,(chuckling) One more.
09x24,Unknown,I told you the phone would ring. You deserve this.
09x24,Unknown,"Thanks, Lily."
09x24,"I love you, Marshmallow. TED",Oh.
09x24,1,45 a.m.
09x24,Unknown,"Well, you were right, Barney, this night was, in fact, legendary, but..."
09x24,Unknown,I know what you're gonna say and I agree.
09x24,Unknown,We're going to Vegas!
09x24,TED,I will be awakened by screaming children in less than...
09x24,(crying),four-and-a-half hours.
09x24,BARNEY,You're staying.
09x24,Unknown,I'm going.
09x24,Unknown,"Judge Fudge, your very first ruling?"
09x24,(deep voice),He stays.
09x24,Unknown,Hey! See?
09x24,Unknown,Tonight is about celebrating our enduring bond as friends.
09x24,Unknown,"Nay, family. Because that's what we are, Ted."
09x24,Unknown,We are fa...
09x24,Unknown,"Okay, fun night, guys. Keep in touch."
09x24,Unknown,"Damn it, Barney."
09x24,Unknown,(choking)
09x24,(strained),Crushing... windpipe.
09x24,Unknown,You're lucky that's the only pipe I'm crushing.
09x24,Unknown,Aah! That woman is half your age.
09x24,Unknown,"Haven't you changed, even a little?"
09x24,Unknown,No. I haven't.
09x24,Unknown,"Look, I know there was a time when it seemed like I was capable of going the distance, but... if it wasn't gonna happen with Robin, then it's just not gonna happen with anyone."
09x24,Unknown,"I am never gonna be a guy who meets a girl and, from the first time I see her, I'm just like, ""You are the love of my life."
09x24,Unknown,"""Everything I have and everything I am is yours forever."""
09x24,Unknown,Really?
09x24,Unknown,"No, I'm just making a point. Move it along."
09x24,Unknown,That's not me.
09x24,Unknown,"I'm the guy who straightens his tie, says something dirty, high-fives himself and then goes and talks to that girl over there."
09x24,Unknown,That's me.
09x24,Unknown,Can I please... just be me?
09x24,Unknown,Judge Fudge?
09x24,Unknown,I'll allow it.
09x24,Unknown,Then I'll a-plow it. Self-five.
09x24,Unknown,Stinson out.
09x24,Unknown,(rock music playing)
09x24,Unknown,(cheering)
09x24,Unknown,Oh!
09x24,(whoops) MARSHALL,"Hey, so are you guys ever gonna tie the knot or are you... are you just comfortable living in sin?"
09x24,Unknown,Someone's gotten a bit... judge-y. Oh!
09x24,Sustained. THE MOTHER,Yeah.
09x24,Unknown,"We'll get around to it. It's just, you know, with life and jobs and kids."
09x24,Unknown,"Plus, this one's still insisting on getting married in a French castle."
09x24,Unknown,"I'd get married tomorrow in a White Castle, but this guy needs more ""wow factor."""
09x24,Unknown,You're all the wow factor I need.
09x24,BARNEY,Aw!
09x24,Unknown,(mimics retching)
09x24,Unknown,Glad someone can be happy on the day of a tragedy.
09x24,LILY,"Aw, Barney, you know this is all fake, right?"
09x24,Unknown,That robot's not really dead.
09x24,Unknown,(laughter)
09x24,Unknown,"I'm not talking about the robot, Lily. Everyone, stop having fun! I'm about to tell a sad story!"
09x24,Unknown,"Guys, remember back in 2010 when I achieved a perfect week?"
09x24,Unknown,"Seven girls in seven nights, sure."
09x24,BARNEY,"Well, recently, I decided to attempt... a perfect month."
09x24,Unknown,I put together a brand-new playbook.
09x24,Unknown,"No, I can't hear this. This is just too sad."
09x24,Unknown,But I haven't gotten to the sad part yet.
09x24,Unknown,You're in your 40s and you have a playbook.
09x24,Unknown,That's the sad part.
09x24,Unknown,Lily... just...
09x24,Unknown,Okay?
09x24,Unknown,"So I put together a brand-new playbook, filled with plays I'd never tried before, like..."
09x24,Unknown,"...where, as in the '80s classic, I magically"
09x24,Unknown,come
09x24,Unknown,"to life, if you know what I mean."
09x24,Unknown,...where I wait till a girl mentions something she likes.
09x24,Unknown,"God, I love nachos."
09x24,Unknown,Thank you.
09x24,Unknown,Allow me to introduce myself.
09x24,Unknown,"My name is Jim, Jim Nacho."
09x24,Unknown,Inventor of the nacho.
09x24,Unknown,So... did you get a perfect month?
09x24,Unknown,Yes.
09x24,Unknown,Then why are you so upset?
09x24,Unknown,"That last girl, number 31..."
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, that's a pretty name. What is that, French?"
09x24,Unknown,...she's pregnant.
09x24,Unknown,"Wait, you're messing with us, right?"
09x24,Unknown,You didn't really get a girl pregnant?
09x24,Unknown,It's real.
09x24,Unknown,She's pregnant.
09x24,Unknown,"Kinda puts an asterisk, on the whole perfect month thing, huh?"
09x24,Unknown,"Barney, are you okay?"
09x24,Unknown,"Ah, Jim Nantz."
09x24,Unknown,Thank goodness. You're always here for me in times of trouble.
09x24,Unknown,What should I do?
09x24,Unknown,"You're on your own this time, bro."
09x24,Unknown,"Congratulations, Papa."
09x24,Unknown,Stop it. This is a disaster.
09x24,Unknown,Why?
09x24,Unknown,Why? Because I'm too old.
09x24,Unknown,"I was about to enter my golden years, my Clooney years, my daddy issues years, where I don't just remind messed-up girls of their dads because I'm emotionally distant."
09x24,Unknown,I freaking look like their dads. That's the dream.
09x24,Unknown,My life is over.
09x24,Unknown,So where are you guys registered?
09x24,Unknown,"Another fun fact about the Goliath National Bank building,"
09x24,Unknown,the sleek but historical facade has been described by
09x24,Unknown,Architecture Vision Monthly
09x24,Unknown,"as ""modern classicism."""
09x24,Unknown,I can see that.
09x24,Unknown,Mm-hmm. Any questions from the group?
09x24,Unknown,I have a question.
09x24,Unknown,What happened to the building that used to be here?
09x24,Unknown,It was way nicer.
09x24,Unknown,Robin!
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, my God!"
09x24,Unknown,What are you doing here?
09x24,Unknown,I thought you were in...
09x24,Unknown,"Greece, uh, Morocco, Moscow."
09x24,Unknown,"Yeah, World Wide News keeps me pretty busy."
09x24,Unknown,And pretty famous.
09x24,Unknown,"I mean, you're everywhere."
09x24,Unknown,I am not everywhere. The...
09x24,Unknown,"Okay, I'm some places."
09x24,(laughs),"Hi, Penny."
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh, I haven't seen you in forever."
09x24,Unknown,"I like you, bus lady. Oh, I like you, too."
09x24,Unknown,Never call me that again.
09x24,Unknown,(giggles)
09x24,Unknown,And that was it.
09x24,Unknown,Wow. Hm.
09x24,Unknown,A genuine Scherbatsky sighting out in nature.
09x24,Unknown,"At this point, that's like seeing Sasquatch."
09x24,Unknown,"No, Sasquatch is a warm and affectionate creature."
09x24,Unknown,"At this point, Robin's more like the yeti... cold and aloof."
09x24,Unknown,"Hey, Ted."
09x24,Unknown,Ask me if the Abominable Snowman called.
09x24,Unknown,Has the Abominable Snowman called?
09x24,Unknown,Not yeti.
09x24,Unknown,Here we are again.
09x24,Unknown,"Another big moment for us, and Robin's missing it."
09x24,MARSHALL,"I know, baby."
09x24,Unknown,"I mean, the birth of her ex-husband's love child is a bit of a stretch... but I know, baby."
09x24,Unknown,(sighs)
09x24,Unknown,Well?
09x24,Unknown,"It was... crazy in there, but..."
09x24,Unknown,"I threw up, and now I feel better."
09x24,Unknown,Where were you?
09x24,Unknown,"In the can. I knew I was gonna urp, so I put this on over my suit."
09x24,Unknown,Number 31 won't let me in the delivery room.
09x24,Unknown,We're gonna need a name eventually.
09x24,Unknown,Mr. Stinson?
09x24,Unknown,Yes? Congratulations.
09x24,Unknown,Congratulations because the blood test came back and I'm not the father?!
09x24,Unknown,Happy Not a Father's Day!
09x24,Unknown,No. Congratulations.
09x24,Unknown,It's a girl.
09x24,Unknown,Would you like to meet her?

09x24,Unknown,Forever.
09x24,Unknown,What?
09x24,Unknown,Do I have stuff in my teeth?
09x24,Unknown,Give me your engagement ring back.
09x24,Unknown,Just because I have stuff in my teeth?
09x24,Unknown,We-we can work through this.
09x24,(laughs),Just give it back.
09x24,Unknown,(clears throat)
09x24,Unknown,"If you don't get married in that time, you have to re-propose."
09x24,Unknown,Will you...
09x24,Unknown,"Yes. Yes, you silly man."
09x24,Unknown,Let me finish.
09x24,Unknown,Will you...
09x24,Unknown,Yes! Sorry.
09x24,Unknown,Yes.

09x24,Unknown,Hi. What to join us for sh*ts?
09x24,(chuckles),sh*ts?
09x24,Unknown,Before lunch on a Thursday?
09x24,Unknown,It's like you're
09x24,Unknown,trying
09x24,Unknown,to make bad decisions.
09x24,Unknown,"You young ladies need to go home, put on some decent clothes and take a good hard look at your lives. Get!"
09x24,Unknown,Call your parents... they're probably worried sick.
09x24,Unknown,I have officially seen everything.
09x24,Unknown,Not everything.
09x24,Unknown,Hi. Hi.
09x24,Unknown,"I-I know I've... missed a couple lately, but... we said we'd always be there for the big moments."
09x24,Unknown,"Aw, crap."
09x24,Unknown,Mascara running.
09x24,Unknown,Nobody let her out of your sight.
09x24,Unknown,"Hi, Daddy. Whoa."
09x24,Unknown,"Look, Robin, I'm really happy to see you, but I don't think of you that way anymore."
09x24,Unknown,", dummy, you had a kid."
09x24,Unknown,"Congrats. Right, yeah."
09x24,Unknown,Thanks. A kid.
09x24,Unknown,I'm tired.
09x24,Unknown,"Oh. But, uh, she's awesome. Yeah?"
09x24,Unknown,Yeah.
09x24,Unknown,Daddy's home.
09x24,Unknown,Mm.
09x24,Unknown,Judge Fudge? Hey?
09x24,Unknown,(laughs) Hey...
09x24,Unknown,"Actually, um, little announcement for everybody."
09x24,Unknown,I'm gonna be running for State Supreme Court.
09x24,Unknown,"Yeah. So if everything goes well, in a couple of months, you won't be calling me Judge Fudge anymore."
09x24,Unknown,You'll be calling me Fudge Supreme.
09x24,Unknown,(others chuckling)
09x24,Unknown,The man of the hour.
09x24,Unknown,Yeah.
09x24,Unknown,You RSVP'd no.
09x24,Unknown,I did.
09x24,Unknown,But someone pretty persuasive talked me into it.
09x24,Unknown,♪
09x24,Unknown,Sorry. I know it's bad luck to see the bride in her dress.
09x24,Unknown,Worth it.
09x24,Unknown,But I couldn't miss this.
09x24,Unknown,I want to get a picture.
09x24,Unknown,Get in! I want to take a picture of you guys.
09x24,Unknown,"Come on, get together."
09x24,Unknown,Are you ready?
09x24,Unknown,"All right, get in. All right. All right."
09x24,Unknown,"One, two, three."
09x24,Unknown,(shutter clicks)
09x24,Unknown,♪
09x24,Unknown,"Hey. Hey, you kids."
09x24,Unknown,"Yeah, you didn't sound a"
09x24,Unknown,thousand
09x24,Unknown,there.
09x24,Unknown,Do you have any idea what happened right here in this very bar?
09x24,Unknown,No. What happened?
09x24,Unknown,(chuckles)
09x24,Unknown,Just...
09x24,Unknown,...just all kinds of stuff.
09x24,Unknown,A toast.
09x24,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
09x24,Unknown,"Okay, first off... to everyone at this table..."
09x24,Unknown,"...I love you guys so much, I can't even..."
09x24,Unknown,"Just move to the second part. Okay, okay."
09x24,Unknown,"Secondly, to Ted..."
09x24,Unknown,Don't say it.
09x24,OTHERS,...Evelyn Mosby.
09x24,Unknown,Thank you for that.
09x24,Unknown,A man with... more emotional endurance than anyone I know.
09x24,Unknown,"It was a long, difficult road."
09x24,Unknown,Thank God we finally got here.
09x24,Unknown,"Hear, hear."
09x24,OTHERS,"Hear, hear."
09x24,Unknown,Aunt Lily wasn't wrong.
09x24,Unknown,"It was at times a long, difficult road."
09x24,Unknown,"But I'm glad it was long and difficult, because if I hadn't gone through hell to get there, the lesson might not have been as clear."
09x24,Unknown,"You see, kids, right from the moment I met your mom, I knew..."
09x24,Unknown,"I have to love this woman as much as I can for as long as I can, and I can never stop loving her, not even for a second."
09x24,"I carried that lesson with me through every stupid fight we ever had, every 5","00 a.m. Christmas morning, every sleepy Sunday afternoon, through every speed bump."
09x24,Unknown,"Every pang of jealousy or boredom or uncertainty that came our way, I carried that lesson with me."
09x24,Unknown,And I carried it with me when she got sick.
09x24,Unknown,"Even then, in what can only be called the worst of times, all I could do was look at her and thank God, thank every god there is, or ever was, or will be, and the whole universe, and anyone else I can possibly thank..."
09x24,Unknown,♪ Will I see you tonight?
09x24,Unknown,"...that I saw that beautiful girl on that train platform, and that I had the guts to stand up, walk over to her, tap her on the shoulder, open my mouth, and speak."
09x24,Unknown,Excuse me. Hi. Hi.
09x24,Unknown,"I'm the... The best man. Yeah. Get in here, get in here, get in here. Oh, thanks. Here, let me."
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, okay. Thank you."
09x24,Unknown,"Great show tonight. Yeah. Oh, thank you."
09x24,Unknown,"You're Cindy's ex-roommate, right?"
09x24,Unknown,Yeah. And you are the professor.
09x24,Unknown,I took one of your classes.
09x24,Unknown,Really? Which one? Mm-hmm.
09x24,Unknown,Econ 305.
09x24,Unknown,Econ 305. I don't teach...
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, no."
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."
09x24,Unknown,"Excuse me, I'm gonna jump onto the tracks now. - No."
09x24,Unknown,"No, no, no, don't. You were great, you were great."
09x24,Unknown,Wait a second.
09x24,Unknown,This is my umbrella.
09x24,Unknown,I left this umbrella at Cindy's... you totally stole my umbrella.
09x24,(laughs),"What? No, I didn't."
09x24,Unknown,This is my umbrella. I bought this.
09x24,Excuse me. It even has my initials on it right here,T.M.
09x24,Unknown,Ted Mosby.
09x24,Unknown,"Yeah. Look again, Ted Mosby."
09x24,Those are my initials,T.M.
09x24,Unknown,"Tracy McConnell. Um, no, Tracy McConnell, it's T.M.--"
09x24,Unknown,Totally My umbrella.
09x24,Unknown,"Uh, your T.M.--"
09x24,"Terribly Mistaken, because this umbrella has always belonged T.M.",To Me.
09x24,Unknown,(laughs)
09x24,Unknown,Although... I did lose it for a few years there.
09x24,Unknown,"Um... so, I went to this dance club..."
09x24,Unknown,On St. Patrick's Day.
09x24,Unknown,...on St. Patrick's Day.
09x24,Unknown,And you left it there.
09x24,Unknown,And I left it there.
09x24,Unknown,And you never thought you'd see it again.
09x24,Unknown,And I never thought I'd see it again.
09x24,Unknown,Funny how sometimes you just... find things.
09x24,Unknown,♪ Will I see you tonight?
09x24,Unknown,Hi.
09x24,(laughs),Hi.
09x24,Unknown,♪
09x24,Unknown,♪ Every night
09x24,Unknown,♪ It's just the same ♪
09x24,Unknown,♪ All upon a downtown train.
09x24,Unknown,"And that, kids... is how I met your mother."
09x24,Unknown,That's it?
09x24,Unknown,That's it.
09x24,Unknown,No. I don't buy it.
09x24,Unknown,That is not the reason you made us listen to this.
09x24,Unknown,"Oh, really?"
09x24,Unknown,Then what's the reason?
09x24,Unknown,Let's look at the facts here.
09x24,Unknown,You made us sit down and listen to this story about how you met mom.
09x24,Unknown,Yet mom's hardly in the story. No.
09x24,Unknown,This is a story about how you're totally in love with Aunt Robin.
09x24,Unknown,"And you're thinking about asking her out, and you want to know if we're okay with it."
09x24,Unknown,I can't believe this.
09x24,Unknown,"I kept this story short and to the point, and you guys still missed it."
09x24,Unknown,The point of the story is that...
09x24,Unknown,"Is that you totally, totally, totally have the hots for Aunt Robin."
09x24,Unknown,"No, I don't."
09x24,Unknown,"Yes, you do."
09x24,Unknown,You're grounded.
09x24,Unknown,"Wow, you are really into Aunt Robin."
09x24,Unknown,"You're grounded, too."
09x24,Unknown,"Okay, suppose I"
09x24,Unknown,were
09x24,Unknown,interested in Aunt Robin in that way... it's not like I'd do anything about it.
09x24,Unknown,"I got you guys to think about. My gosh, we"
09x24,Unknown,love
09x24,Unknown,Aunt Robin.
09x24,Unknown,"Whenever she comes over for dinner, you guys are so obvious."
09x24,Unknown,"Come on, Dad."
09x24,Unknown,Mom's been gone for six years now.
09x24,Unknown,It's time.
09x24,Unknown,"What, I just... just call her up on the phone and ask her out on a date?"
09x24,Unknown,Yes. Yes.
09x24,Unknown,And that... that's something you guys would want?
09x24,Unknown,Yes! Yes!
09x24,Unknown,"All right, I'll give her a call."
09x24,Unknown,Do it. I am.
09x24,Unknown,Call her. I'm
09x24,Unknown,calling
