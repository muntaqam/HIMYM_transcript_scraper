08x01,Unknown,"Oh, you look like you're coming from a wedding."
08x01,Unknown,Was it a nice one?
08x01,Unknown,"Uh, it's a long story, and I don't mean to be rude, but I really don't feel like talking about it."
08x01,Unknown,It all started when the bride asked to see me...
08x01,Unknown,Wow.
08x01,Unknown,"Okay, don't sugarcoat it, Mosby."
08x01,Unknown,"Just give it to me straight, okay?"
08x01,Unknown,How bad is Barney freaking out right now?
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, he's fine."
08x01,Unknown,"No, I'm serious. He's totally fine."
08x01,Unknown,I have a better tie at home!
08x01,Unknown,It's cornflower blue!
08x01,Unknown,It's cornflower blue!
08x01,Unknown,"You may rest assured, Barney Stinson is absolutely 100%"
08x01,Unknown,going through with this wedding.
08x01,Unknown,(sighs)
08x01,Unknown,Okay.
08x01,Unknown,Good news.
08x01,Unknown,"Um, just one small issue, uh..."
08x01,Unknown,I can't go through with this wedding.

08x01,Unknown,"Original Air Date on September 24, 2012"
08x01,Unknown,"Okay, calm down, everyone feels this way on their wedding day."
08x01,Unknown,It'll pass. No.
08x01,Unknown,It's more than that.
08x01,Unknown,I'm having a serious crisis.
08x01,Unknown,And I wonder if it would be hard to climb out that window.
08x01,Unknown,"Uh, climbing out's easy."
08x01,Unknown,Climbing in's the real challenge.
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, right."
08x01,Unknown,"It's the same window, isn't it?"
08x01,Unknown,Yeah.
08x01,Unknown,Narrator
08x01,Unknown,That story transpired in May of 2012.
08x01,Unknown,"As you may recall, Lily and Marshall were gloriously happy having just welcomed your cousin Marvin."
08x01,Unknown,While Barney and Quinn were gloriously happy having just gotten engaged.
08x01,Unknown,"And Robin, well..."
08x01,Unknown,"Ah, got it!"
08x01,Unknown,"Man, that sum'b*tch had been in there since breakfast!"
08x01,Unknown,I think there's some in the fridge.
08x01,Unknown,We'll get it.
08x01,Unknown,"We're totally not gonna go have sex in the kitchen, if that's what you're thinking."
08x01,Unknown,"Aw, we're not?"
08x01,Unknown,"No, no, we are. I already took off your bra."
08x01,Unknown,Oh!
08x01,Unknown,"Hey, are you guys sure you can handle champagne?"
08x01,Unknown,You haven't slept in like a week.
08x01,Unknown,We should just call it a night.
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, I see what this is about."
08x01,Unknown,You feel weird because Barney's engaged.
08x01,Unknown,What?!
08x01,Unknown,No. Of course not.
08x01,Unknown,And I will tell you why it's not weird.
08x01,Unknown,What's not weird?
08x01,Unknown,The fact that Barney's engaged.
08x01,Unknown,Barney's engaged?!
08x01,Unknown,"Heck, this calls for some champagne."
08x01,Unknown,I think there's some in the fridge.
08x01,"Oh, my God, why don't you both just admit it",You're deliriously exhausted.
08x01,Unknown,Both
08x01,,We're fine!
08x01,Unknown,Really? We're not gonna be the kind of people who have a baby and become total zombies.
08x01,Unknown,Marshall
08x01,,"Yes, Robin."
08x01,Unknown,We're not gonna be the kind of people that have a zombie and become total babies.
08x01,Unknown,"Okay, well, what the I was saying is..."
08x01,Unknown,"(slow, garbled speech)"
08x01,Unknown,Do you understand?
08x01,Unknown,"Yes! God, yes!"
08x01,Unknown,"You are preaching to the choir, sister."
08x01,Unknown,Whew!
08x01,Unknown,Hey. So...
08x01,Unknown,"I am thinking about my bridal party and, uh, I don't have a lot of girlfriends."
08x01,Unknown,"I mean, I have work friends, but I worked at a strip club and I know they'll just complain about any bridesmaid's dress that has a front, so..."
08x01,Unknown,Would you guys be my bridesmaids?
08x01,Unknown,I'd be honored. Yes!
08x01,Unknown,"Not you, Marshall."
08x01,Unknown,"But, yay, thank you! Oh."
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, thank you. Oh, my gosh."
08x01,Unknown,It's gonna be so much fun.
08x01,Unknown,"Yeah, now it's weird."
08x01,Unknown,What's weird?
08x01,Unknown,Me being Quinn's bridesmaid.
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, sweetie."
08x01,Unknown,She probably won't even ask you.
08x01,Unknown,She just did.
08x01,Unknown,And we both said yes.
08x01,Unknown,"Heck, this calls for some champagne."
08x01,Unknown,I think there's some in the fridge.
08x01,Unknown,Narrator
08x01,Unknown,"Meanwhile, I was also gloriously happy, driving off into the sunset with Victoria, who left her fiance Klaus at the altar for me."
08x01,Unknown,There was just one problem.
08x01,Unknown,I wonder if Klaus found your note yet.
08x01,Unknown,My note?
08x01,Unknown,"Yeah, you know, the ""I'm leaving you at the altar"" note."
08x01,Unknown,Is that a thing?
08x01,Unknown,(tires screech)
08x01,Unknown,"When you leave someone at the altar, you always leave a note."
08x01,Unknown,It's common courtesy.
08x01,Unknown,I think common courtesy went out the window when I did.
08x01,Unknown,"Look, when Stella left me at the altar, at least I got an explanation."
08x01,Unknown,"I mean, that note is what keeps you sane."
08x01,Unknown,"You read it, you re-read it, you memorize it, you sleep with it, you sniff it because it still kind of smells like her, and then, finally... you let it go... tied to a brick, right through her perfect little suburban bay window."
08x01,Unknown,I'll just text him.
08x01,Unknown,You're leaving a note.
08x01,Unknown,"So, Barney and I have already disagreed on a few of the wedding details."
08x01,Unknown,"I want to go with a buffet, and he wants to ride down the aisle on a grizzly bear."
08x01,Unknown,He'll be wearing a tux.
08x01,Unknown,"Fine, fine, I'll settle for a panda bear, but you have to call my tailor."
08x01,Unknown,He'll be furious about the switch.
08x01,Unknown,Robin
08x01,,"Hey, Barney, uh..."
08x01,Unknown,We've gotta talk.
08x01,Unknown,"Um, Quinn just asked me to be one of her bridesmaids."
08x01,Unknown,Isn't she even a little weirded out that you and I used to date?
08x01,Unknown,Quinn doesn't have a jealous bone in her body.
08x01,Unknown,She rolls with the punches.
08x01,Unknown,She... Doesn't have a clue.
08x01,Unknown,"No, she does not."
08x01,Unknown,Okay.
08x01,Unknown,"Okay. ""Klaus, there is no easy way to tell you why I won't be marrying you today."
08x01,Unknown,"Have a great summer, Victoria."""
08x01,Unknown,That's it?
08x01,Unknown,"No, no, we gotta do this right."
08x01,Unknown,"Well, you can't write it."
08x01,Unknown,"One look, it's gonna be obvious it's a guy's handwri..."
08x01,Unknown,"Oh no, we're good."
08x01,Unknown,"Okay, fine, you write, I'll advise."
08x01,Unknown,(sighs)
08x01,Unknown,"""Klaus."""
08x01,Unknown,"Just ""Klaus""?"
08x01,Unknown,"Come on, give it some heart, the poor guy. ""Dear sweet Klaus..."" ""Sweet?"" What, are you still in love with this jerk?"
08x01,Unknown,I'm doing this on my own.
08x01,Unknown,"I'm sorry, I just... you know, I feel bad for the guy."
08x01,Unknown,I'm stealing the greatest girl in the world away from him.
08x01,Unknown,You're not stealing me.
08x01,Unknown,I'm choosing you.
08x01,Unknown,Because you are loving and you are caring... and you are going to go deliver this note.
08x01,Unknown,"Wait, you want me to go in there?"
08x01,Unknown,"It took everything I had to climb out that church window today. and if I have to go back in there, I'm not sure I can do it again."
08x01,Unknown,It has to smell like you.
08x01,Unknown,(shuts door)
08x01,Unknown,So Quinn has no idea that we used to date?
08x01,Unknown,None whatsoever.
08x01,Unknown,"Okay, Barney, think this through."
08x01,Unknown,Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with Quinn...
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, God, you have a point."
08x01,Unknown,Haven't gotten to it yet.
08x01,Unknown,(anxious laugh)
08x01,Unknown,Of course. Continue.
08x01,Unknown,Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with Quinn and keep this secret?
08x01,Unknown,"I mean, she's gonna find out."
08x01,Unknown,Quinn's not gonna find out because I've destroyed every piece of evidence that you and I were ever a couple.
08x01,Unknown,That's ridiculous.
08x01,Unknown,You couldn't have gotten rid of all of it.
08x01,Unknown,You replaced me with a tiger.
08x01,Unknown,I couldn't completely get you out of that one.
08x01,Unknown,Had to get creative.
08x01,Unknown,"Well, I'm glad that deleting our entire time together was so easy for you."
08x01,But I guarantee you,Quinn is gonna find out eventually.
08x01,Unknown,"No, she won't."
08x01,Unknown,I just need your help.
08x01,Unknown,"Yours, too."
08x01,Unknown,"I know you're out of it, but you have to promise not to tell Quinn, okay?"
08x01,Unknown,Tell Quinn what?
08x01,Unknown,Exactly.
08x01,Unknown,"No, she's really asking."
08x01,Unknown,Tell Quinn what?
08x01,Unknown,(water burbling)
08x01,Unknown,Both
08x01,,Ooooooh...
08x01,Unknown,Can't climb the drainpipe. What?
08x01,Unknown,"When I was in fourth grade, I couldn't climb the rope in gym class and all the other kids made fun of me, even though it wasn't my fault."
08x01,Unknown,I had to go after Efthimios Papajapoulos.
08x01,Unknown,The rope was slick with lamb grease!
08x01,Unknown,"Okay, so just walk in the front door and act like you belong."
08x01,Unknown,Here.
08x01,Unknown,Here's the key to the dressing room.
08x01,Unknown,Can I help you?
08x01,Unknown,Hi. I'm the church handyman.
08x01,Unknown,I'm here to fix the broken thing.
08x01,Unknown,It's busted.
08x01,Unknown,"The bride is taking a ""schnooze."""
08x01,Unknown,She asked me to stand watch so that no one disturbs her.
08x01,Unknown,I'll be quick.
08x01,Unknown,You will be dead.
08x01,Unknown,I used to wrestle in Leipzig.
08x01,Unknown,You know what?
08x01,Unknown,A note's redundant.
08x01,Unknown,You're not there. He gets it.
08x01,Unknown,"No, you were right, I have to leave a note."
08x01,Unknown,It's common courtesy.
08x01,Unknown,"Well, it's not gonna be possible with Andrea the Giant standing guard up there."
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, right, Klaus's sister."
08x01,Unknown,It's too bad Barney's not here.
08x01,Unknown,"Man, he lives for bridesmaids."
08x01,Unknown,"Right, but he's not."
08x01,Unknown,And it's not like he could seduce Uta over the phone.
08x01,Unknown,Challenge accepted!
08x01,Unknown,"Honey, it's not cheating if it's on the phone, right?"
08x01,Unknown,Say what now?
08x01,Unknown,Quinn's on board!
08x01,Unknown,Text me her number!
08x01,Unknown,"You filthy, disgusting man!"
08x01,Unknown,"But yes, I will do that to myself at your instruction."
08x01,Unknown,Let me find a broom closet.
08x01,Unknown,"Oh,"
08x01,Unknown,"ja,"
08x01,Unknown,good.
08x01,Unknown,I did it. I did it!
08x01,Unknown,You're amazing.
08x01,Unknown,Let's get out of here.
08x01,Unknown,I left the car keys in the dressing room.
08x01,Unknown,Pretty sure the door locked behind me.
08x01,Unknown,(car horn beeping)
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, God... Oh, God... Oh, God..."
08x01,Unknown,I found it kind of insulting that Barney doesn't think we can keep this secret.
08x01,Unknown,"I mean, yeah, Marvin's keeping us up all night."
08x01,Unknown,But he's still the prettiest little girl in the city.
08x01,Unknown,"Baby, did you just hear yourself?"
08x01,Unknown,"You said, ""Prettiest little girl in the city."""
08x01,Unknown,"I think you meant ""country"""""
08x01,Unknown,Yeah.
08x01,Unknown,"I mean, what does Barney think?"
08x01,Unknown,We're just gonna blurt out that he used to date...
08x01,Unknown,Shh!
08x01,Unknown,Oh... that was close.
08x01,Unknown,Quinn could've heard us through the...
08x01,Unknown,(mouthing)
08x01,Unknown,Good catch!
08x01,Unknown,I almost just blurted out that Barney used to date Robin!
08x01,Unknown,Barney used to date Robin?!
08x01,Unknown,(screaming)
08x01,Unknown,(baby crying)
08x01,Unknown,When did you get in here?
08x01,Unknown,"Like, ten minutes ago when you said, ""Hey Quinn, let's all go hang out in Marvin's room."""
08x01,Unknown,"Aufwiedersehen, fraulein."
08x01,Unknown,"You know, I hate to perpetuate the stereotype, but German female wrestlers from Saxony are just begging for it."
08x01,Unknown,You dated Robin?
08x01,Unknown,Verdammt!
08x01,Unknown,I'm sorry I lied to you. I'll tell you everything.
08x01,Unknown,The whole story. Fine. You have one minute before I walk out that door.
08x01,Unknown,"Um, it's, uh, kind of a long story, Quinn."
08x01,Unknown,Gonna take a bit little longer than a minute.
08x01,Unknown,52 seconds.
08x01,Unknown,"Seven years ago, when Marshall and Lily got engaged, Ted saw Robin across a crowded room, and I said, ""Oh, yeah, you just know she likes it dirty,"" but Ted really liked her so we played ""Have you met Ted?"""
08x01,Unknown,"They went to dinner, he walked her home, shoulda kissed her, didn't-- lame-- so he stole a smurf penis, went back to her place, should've kissed her, didn't-- lame."
08x01,Unknown,"He threw three parties, they kissed on the roof, but decided to be friends--"
08x01,Unknown,lame--
08x01,Unknown,"then Ted wanted to take Robin to a wedding, she couldn't go, he went alone and met Victoria, didn't kiss her either-- lame--"
08x01,Unknown,"not a great closer, Ted--"
08x01,Unknown,"but he finally kissed her, they started dating, she went to Germany, Ted kissed Robin, lost Victoria, Ted did a rain dance, got Robin, Ted and Robin broke up, Robin moved to Brazil, came back with a Latin stud, Ted got jealous, got a tramp stamp, not really relevant to the story I just like mentioning that as much as possible, I hooked up with Robin, Ted and I stopped being friends, Ted got hit by a bus, we made up..."
08x01,Unknown,"Robin and I started dating, I got fat, her hair fell out."
08x01,Unknown,"We broke up, Robin dated Don, I dated Nora, cheated on her with Robin, I dumped Nora, Robin dated Kevin, but not for long, and then I met you and you took my grandpa's watch but I fell in love with you anyway, and you let me fart in front of you and I asked you to marry me and you said yes and we came over here to meet little Marvin and that's everything!"
08x01,Unknown,Also I went on the
08x01,Unknown,Price Is Right
08x01,Unknown,and won a dune buggy.
08x01,Unknown,"Goodbye, Barney."
08x01,Unknown,Good... I j...
08x01,Unknown,She lets you fart in front of her?
08x01,Unknown,Marshall
08x01,,Barney... you go get that girl.
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, God!"
08x01,Unknown,You cannot tell anyone that you saw me.
08x01,Unknown,I cannot get married today!
08x01,Unknown,Klaus?
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, I'm a mess."
08x01,Unknown,"I threw up in the cloakroom, I blamed a small child."
08x01,Unknown,I cannot get married.
08x01,Unknown,I left a note.
08x01,Unknown,Good for you. Not everyone thinks of that.
08x01,Unknown,Who doesn't leave a note?
08x01,Unknown,It's common courtesy.
08x01,Unknown,Thank you!
08x01,Unknown,Do you have the time? Um...
08x01,"Yeah, it's 20 after 7",00.
08x01,Unknown,"Ah,"
08x01,Unknown,sehr gut.
08x01,I can still make the 8,05 back to the city.
08x01,Unknown,Auf wiedersehen!
08x01,Unknown,Narrator
08x01,And suddenly it hit me,a way to absolve Victoria of any blame.
08x01,Unknown,All I had to do was climb that drainpipe.
08x01,Unknown,"What? No, Klaus, no."
08x01,Unknown,(melodramatic weeping)
08x01,Unknown,"Mach schnell,"
08x01,Unknown,"sleepyhead, it's time to..."
08x01,Unknown,I know about you and Barney.
08x01,Unknown,(Marshall gasps)
08x01,Unknown,Who told her?!
08x01,Unknown,You guys did.
08x01,Unknown,"God, go to sleep."
08x01,Unknown,"Okay, no one is going anywhere until we find out who told you."
08x01,Unknown,Look... there is nothing going on between me and Robin.
08x01,Unknown,And why should I believe that?
08x01,Unknown,"Well, for starters, I have a boyfriend."
08x01,Unknown,"No, Robin, you don't have to do this."
08x01,Unknown,There've been enough lies.
08x01,Unknown,I'm not lying.
08x01,Unknown,His name is Nick.
08x01,Unknown,"I didn't want to jinx it by telling everyone, so I just told Marshall and Lily."
08x01,Unknown,"You can tell 'em, guys."
08x01,Unknown,We were just talking about this earlier today.
08x01,Unknown,Robin
08x01,,"Okay, well, what I was saying is..."
08x01,Unknown,(water burbling)
08x01,Unknown,"I have no desire to get Barney back because I'm with Nick now and, well, I don't want to be crude, but I want to spend all day licking his abs."
08x01,Unknown,Do you understand?
08x01,Unknown,"Yes! God, yes!"
08x01,Unknown,"You are preaching to the choir, sister."
08x01,Unknown,I stand by it.
08x01,Unknown,"Guys, it's okay."
08x01,Unknown,You're new parents.
08x01,Unknown,You just need to get some sleep.
08x01,Unknown,We're fine!
08x01,Unknown,(baby crying)
08x01,Unknown,(Marshall and Lily crying)
08x01,Unknown,"This is hard, guys."
08x01,Unknown,Really hard.
08x01,Unknown,"(crying, then snoring)"
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, God! Stay with me."
08x01,Unknown,Stay with me.
08x01,Unknown,Go get your baby. Yeah.
08x01,Unknown,"Look, it doesn't matter that you have a boyfriend."
08x01,Unknown,I'm always gonna be wondering if you secretly still have feelings for Barney.
08x01,Unknown,I don't care who this guy is.
08x01,Unknown,"Okay, we're good."
08x01,Unknown,"Okay, well, I'm glad I left work early for this."
08x01,Unknown,"Robin, maybe later we can discuss the meaning of the word ""emergency"" and the phrase ""Trapped under a car."""
08x01,Unknown,Okay. Okay.
08x01,Unknown,You know he has chicken legs.
08x01,Unknown,Little tiny chicken legs.
08x01,Unknown,"You guys saw those, right?"
08x01,Unknown,"Honey, it's not cheating if I lie down on the bar and let Nick do a shot from my belly button, right?"
08x01,Unknown,Say what now?
08x01,Unknown,Barney's on board!
08x01,Unknown,"Nick, hold on!"
08x01,Unknown,Thanks for your help today.
08x01,Unknown,"Yeah, sure."
08x01,Unknown,"Although, it, uh, kind of sucked seeing how easy it was for you to throw away everything from our relationship."
08x01,Unknown,(scoffs)
08x01,Unknown,I... I could never do that.
08x01,Unknown,622 West 14th Street.
08x01,Unknown,Narrator
08x01,Unknown,"And so, Victoria and I were back where we started."
08x01,Unknown,But there was something I couldn't get off my mind...
08x01,Unknown,I'll be right back.
08x01,Unknown,"Uh, excuse me."
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, hey, it's you."
08x01,Unknown,"Ja,"
08x01,Unknown,"okay, I'm not sure what kind of vibe I was giving off before, but I am not interested in your schnitzel, okay?"
08x01,Unknown,"No, no, no, no, no-- God, no."
08x01,I-I just have one quick question,Victoria seems like a great girl.
08x01,Unknown,Why wouldn't you want to marry her?
08x01,Unknown,"Ach, okay, Victoria is"
08x01,Unknown,wunderbar.
08x01,Unknown,"I'm sorry,"
08x01,Unknown,wunderbar
08x01,Unknown,is the German word for wonderful.
08x01,Unknown,"Yeah, no, I know."
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, you speak German?"
08x01,Unknown,"Sie sprechen Deutsch? Ich habe keine Freund, die Deutsch sprechen in Amerika und und es macht mir so einsam!"
08x01,Unknown,No...
08x01,Unknown,"No, no, no..."
08x01,Unknown,"No, just-just-just the one word."
08x01,Unknown,Oh. Oh.
08x01,Unknown,"Ah... Okay, Victoria."
08x01,Unknown,Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz.
08x01,Unknown,"And the closest translation would be... ""Lifelong Treasure of Destiny."""
08x01,Unknown,And Victoria is
08x01,Unknown,"wunderbar,"
08x01,Unknown,but she is not my
08x01,Unknown,Lebenslangerschicksalsschatz.
08x01,Unknown,She is my
08x01,Unknown,"Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand,"
08x01,Unknown,you know?
08x01,Unknown,You know
08x01,Unknown,wunderbar
08x01,Unknown,but you don't know
08x01,Unknown,Beinaheleidenschaftsgegenstand?
08x01,Unknown,That is something we learn in kindergarten.
08x01,Unknown,"I'm sorry, ""kindergarten"" is the German word for--"
08x01,Unknown,"No, no, I know that one."
08x01,Unknown,"Oh, okay."

08x02,Unknown,Everyone was happy as can be.

08x02,Unknown,It all started when Barney got a little friendly advice from a coworker.
08x02,Unknown,"Get a prenup, or I'll neuter you before she ever has a chance!"
08x02,Unknown,"First of all, if you have an onion bagel, you don't need scallion cream cheese."

08x02,Unknown,"Secondly, Quinn is a great girl."
08x02,Unknown,I trust her.
08x02,Unknown,"Oh, Darlene was a great girl."
08x02,Unknown,I trusted her.
08x02,Unknown,And then she took everything!
08x02,Unknown,"My house, my car... my dog Tugboat."
08x02,Unknown,I even lost out with the kids.
08x02,Unknown,Full custody!
08x02,Unknown,I got full custody of those kids!
08x02,Unknown,Your kids are horrible.
08x02,Unknown,The worst.
08x02,Unknown,"Barney, I watched as Darlene cut everything good out of my life like a deranged surgeon hacking out organs, and that's not a metaphor."
08x02,Unknown,She got one of my kidneys.

08x02,Unknown,Cross it out.

08x02,Unknown,I can hear you.
08x02,Unknown,I'll cross it out.
08x02,Unknown,I didn't really cross it out.
08x02,Unknown,"Hey, hey..."
08x02,Unknown,"Hey, guys, what's up?"
08x02,Unknown,"Oh, Quinn's pissed because Barney wants her to sign a crazy prenup."

08x02,Unknown,"Yes. Well, I'm new to this but guessing yes."
08x02,Unknown,"Okay, look."
08x02,Unknown,"Did I go... a speck of sand, a fairy eyelash, a unicorn whisper too far?"
08x02,Unknown,Perhaps.
08x02,Unknown,But can you tell me there's nothing in any of your relationships you'd want to change?
08x02,Unknown,No behavior you'd want to outlaw?
08x02,Unknown,No terms you'd want to renegotiate?

08x02,Unknown,Marshall
08x02,,"But on this one, he may have a point. I mean, look... the idea of renegotiating the terms of the relationship, that's valid."
08x02,Unknown,NICK
08x02,,(scoffs): No.
08x02,Unknown,There isn't anything about you that I'd want to change.
08x02,Unknown,"Well, okay, maybe a couple of things."
08x02,Unknown,Women
08x02,,Like what?
08x02,Unknown,Narrator
08x02,Unknown,And just like that... one of these four couples would break up the very next day.
08x02,Unknown,"Okay, it wasn't Lily and Marshall."
08x02,Unknown,One of these three couples would break up the very next day.
08x02,Unknown,"What happened? So last night Nick was all like, ""Barney has a point ""about renegotiating the terms of the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."" Yeah, and Marshall was all like, ""Uh, I want to blah, of the blah, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."""
08x02,Unknown,If I shut my eyes it's like they're here.
08x02,Unknown,They're just using Barney's prenup as a way to complain about us.
08x02,Unknown,"I'm just saying, you've forbidden certain things that I might like to revisit."
08x02,Unknown,"Marshall, you're not going on a Sasquatch hunt in Oregon with a bunch of loonies."
08x02,Unknown,Loonies?
08x02,Unknown,"Those brave, bearded men and women are crypto-zoologists, and they deserve the respect that title commands."
08x02,Unknown,But that's not what I was thinking of.
08x02,Unknown,You're too precious with the baby.
08x02,Unknown,Lily
08x02,Unknown,"Okay,"
08x02,Unknown,"when we first came home with Marvin, there was a bad moment."
08x02,Unknown,"Welcome home, buddy."
08x02,Unknown,(gasps)
08x02,Unknown,(baby giggles)
08x02,Unknown,Robin
08x02,Unknown,Was it really
08x02,Unknown,that high?
08x02,Unknown,I don't know. I was hormonal.
08x02,Unknown,"And suddenly, this primal, protective mother voice came out of me."
08x02,Unknown,"Actually, it was two voices."
08x02,Unknown,I seriously think one was coming from my vag*na.
08x02,"(deep, echoing)",Never do that again!
08x02,Unknown,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What is the big deal?"
08x02,Unknown,My brothers and my dad used to roughhouse with me all the time.
08x02,Unknown,"Welcome home, Marshall."
08x02,Unknown,Hi. Boys... go long.
08x02,Unknown,(baby giggles)
08x02,Unknown,Stop! Not in the house.
08x02,Unknown,That's how lamps break.
08x02,Unknown,Now go pass that baby around outside.
08x02,Unknown,"Oh, fumble!"
08x02,Unknown,And I turned out perfectly fine.
08x02,Unknown,"Marshall, this morning you thought a ghost made your toast."
08x02,Unknown,I didn't put the bread in.
08x02,Unknown,You didn't put the bread in.
08x02,Unknown,You know what? I will play with my son however I see fit. And you know what else?
08x02,Unknown,You can honka-honka yourself tonight.
08x02,Unknown,Robin
08x02,Unknown,Barney's prenup
08x02,Unknown,"ruined my night, too."
08x02,Unknown,"Okay, uh, what behavior of mine don't you like?"
08x02,Unknown,I'm talking about the TV thing.
08x02,Unknown,"Okay, the TV thing is an argument from, like, three weeks ago."
08x02,Unknown,Mmm.
08x02,Unknown,(Nick laughs)
08x02,Unknown,(sighs)
08x02,Unknown,Uh...
08x02,Unknown,"Oh, I'm sorry."
08x02,Unknown,Didn't realize it takes 42 inches to keep you satisfied.
08x02,Unknown,Robin
08x02,Unknown,The TV happened
08x02,Unknown,to be on. I happened to glance at it.
08x02,Unknown,Does that make me so weird? No.
08x02,Unknown,Not at all. Thank you.
08x02,Unknown,I may be a little weird.
08x02,Unknown,Mmm.
08x02,Unknown,(Nick laughs)
08x02,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."
08x02,Unknown,Robin
08x02,,I get... turned on watching myself do the news during sex.
08x02,Unknown,"Yeah, that's a little weird."
08x02,Unknown,"Look, seeing myself on TV makes me feel confident and sexy."
08x02,Unknown,"And that is nothing to be ashamed of, right, sisters?"
08x02,Unknown,Never speak of this. Ever.
08x02,Unknown,"Yeah, of course. Yeah."
08x02,Unknown,There's more.
08x02,Unknown,Lily
08x02,Unknown,Wait.
08x02,So when you're doing the news live at 7,"00, you wink to future you watching the rebroadcast at 11:00?"
08x02,Unknown,Maybe.
08x02,Unknown,Never speak of this.
08x02,Unknown,Ever!
08x02,Unknown,You won't believe what Ted did last night.
08x02,Unknown,You said you were happy to help him out.
08x02,Unknown,"Well, now I'm changing my mind."
08x02,Unknown,"Sorry to interrupt, roomie, but I am trying to make sausage. Where do you keep your pig intestines?"
08x02,Unknown,What's your ex-fiancé
08x02,Unknown,doing at Ted's?
08x02,Unknown,Klaus came to me a few weeks ago.
08x02,Unknown,"Since we broke up, he lost his job, he got evicted."
08x02,Unknown,He's miserable.
08x02,(sobs),I'm so sorry.
08x02,Unknown,"If I could just take a quick whore's bath in your kitchen sink, then I will skedaddle."
08x02,Unknown,"Oh, Klaus, I wish that there was something I could do to help."
08x02,Unknown,Ted
08x02,,"There is, little lady. I've got a guest room."
08x02,Unknown,You'll stay here till you're back on your feet.

08x02,Unknown,It's all pretty standard.
08x02,Unknown,This might not be the best time to ask--

08x02,Unknown,Nothing. I'd just sit around and watch them go out of style.

08x02,Unknown,"In the event that you have a son, Mr. Stinson is free to play with his child however he sees fit."
08x02,Unknown,How about forbidding your future husband from spiking his child into his crib?
08x02,Unknown,How about a clause protecting you from having to engage in a three-way with her and whatever's on basic cable?
08x02,Unknown,"Oh, yeah? How about forbidding..."
08x02,Unknown,I got nothing.
08x02,Unknown,How about a provision barring any nudist German ex-fiancés from slapping his strudel up and down your sofa?
08x02,Unknown,"How about pretending to be a hero, but then caving the moment a ferret bite breaks the skin?"
08x02,Unknown,The skin of my eyelid.
08x02,Unknown,That's how they kiss.
08x02,Unknown,Are you serious?
08x02,Unknown,(overlapping arguing)
08x02,Unknown,Enough! Enough!
08x02,Unknown,"You all have someone who loves you, and you're screwing it up, and over what?"
08x02,Unknown,Who has the most power?
08x02,Unknown,That's not love.

08x02,Unknown,"You're an amazing mom, and I want to live up to that."
08x02,Unknown,"Well, I probably have trust issues because my dad wasn't there for me."
08x02,Unknown,But I know that you'll always be there to catch Marvin.
08x02,Unknown,"You, next."
08x02,Unknown,Having Klaus back in our lives made me scared we're never gonna escape the past.
08x02,Unknown,I only wanted to help Klaus because I feel guilty about how happy I am with you.
08x02,Unknown,Next.
08x02,Unknown,"I find you so sexy, it just hurt that you don't feel the same about me."

08x03,Unknown,"Oh, can I open it, can I open it, can I open it?"
08x03,Unknown,What about Baby Edgar's mom?

08x03,"And in the end, the coroner's report confirmed what I already feared",the female body cannot withstand that many consecutive orgasms.
08x03,Unknown,I blame myself.

08x03,Unknown,"Once I got the nannies all sympathetic, I had to check their qualifications."
08x03,Unknown,I'd like to see how you handle bath time.
08x03,Unknown,Follow me to the tub.
08x03,Unknown,Should I get the baby?
08x03,Unknown,No.
08x03,Unknown,I'm just gonna take the batteries out of these smoke detectors. Cool? Cool.
08x03,Unknown,"Once the interview was over, I went in for the k*ll."
08x03,Unknown,You're perfect for the job.
08x03,Unknown,"So, congratulations, you're hi..."
08x03,Unknown,No.
08x03,Unknown,I can't do this.
08x03,Unknown,"I find you very attractive, and it wouldn't be appropriate."
08x03,Unknown,It wouldn't be appropriate.
08x03,Unknown,It wouldn't be appropriate.
08x03,Unknown,I repeat--
08x03,Unknown,it would not be appropriate.
08x03,Unknown,It was like taking candy from an imaginary baby!
08x03,Unknown,"Barney, I just went five months with no help, and interviewed 92 nannies before finding one we liked, and you ruined everything the night before I'm supposed to go back to work?"
08x03,Unknown,Thank you for being the most immature person I have ever met.
08x03,Unknown,"Marshall, let's go."
08x03,Unknown,Five more minutes!

08x03,Unknown,holding a monkey?
08x03,Unknown,"Well, a little later, I got kind of hungry."
08x03,Unknown,"So I gave him a bath, and put his diaper rash ointment on, and fed him strained peas, not bananas, 'cause he had bananas yesterday, and I did the laundry, finished my burrito, put him down for his nap at noon, sterilized the bottles, and then we just went to the park."
08x03,Unknown,Okay.
08x03,Unknown,Wow. That's incredible.
08x03,Unknown,When did you get so good with kids?
08x03,Unknown,"You know something, honey, you don't remember this, but, um, for the first few years of your life, your mom worked, and I was a stay-at-home dad."
08x03,Unknown,I thought Grandma and Grandpa took care of me.
08x03,Unknown,"Well, they visited a lot, but I was the guy who took care of you."
08x03,Unknown,"You know, America thinks I ran into that burning house to get potato salad, but I actually ran in to get this photo album."
08x03,Unknown,And potato salad. Sure.

08x05,Unknown,And now who's ready to eat my meat?
08x05,Unknown,(audience gasps)
08x05,Unknown,"Oh, come on."
08x05,Unknown,"But Robin's happy with Nick, and I'm happy with you."
08x05,Unknown,"Look, I, I just asked you to be my wife."
08x05,Unknown,Isn't that proof there's nothing between me and Robin?
08x05,Unknown,"Well, maybe today there isn't, but what about tomorrow?"
08x05,Unknown,Or next week or 15 years from now?
08x05,Unknown,I'll always be wondering.
08x05,Unknown,"I never wanted to be that girl who says it's Robin or it's me, but, well..."
08x05,Unknown,It's Robin or it's you.
08x05,Unknown,You've been a hell of a wingman.
08x05,Unknown,"And even though I think it's kind of gross when you pleasure yourself orally, don't ever think that means I'm not impressed."
08x05,Unknown,Hey... do you think that Barney's gonna be okay bringing Brover back?
08x05,Unknown,"Yeah, he'll be fine."
08x05,(crying),"It's not just the ability to go to town on yourself, but you do it with such joie de vivre."
08x05,Unknown,I really think that I should go with him.
08x05,Unknown,"No, but you got to eat these crêpes as soon as they're flambéed."
08x05,Unknown,They're gonna be bon appe-sweet!
08x05,Unknown,No. Damn.
08x05,Unknown,We'll work on it when I get back.
08x05,Unknown,"No, I get it. You know, I only spent all night working on these, but, hey, Barney's more important."
08x05,Unknown,Nick... It's fine. Go.
08x05,Unknown,"Anyway, let's not make a big deal of it."
08x05,Unknown,"We hung out for a few days, had some fun..."
08x05,Unknown,No big woof.
08x05,Unknown,(barks)
08x05,(sobbing),I don't know who I am without you.
08x05,Unknown,This is crazy.
08x05,Unknown,"Victoria is being completely unreasonable about Robin, and my snap sister is gonna back me up."
08x05,Unknown,(snaps fingers)
08x05,Unknown,I say again...
08x05,Unknown,(snaps fingers)
08x05,Unknown,I kind of see Victoria's point.
08x05,Unknown,Come again for Ms. Fudge?
08x05,Unknown,Ted and Robin have so much history.
08x05,Unknown,Exactly. History. Ancient history.
08x05,Unknown,"Ted, you said ""I love you"" to her earlier this year."
08x05,Unknown,"I'm not saying this is fair, but I get it."
08x05,Unknown,I didn't get that at all.
08x05,Unknown,How could my inner goddess be so far off?
08x05,Unknown,"Oh, you'll get there, honey."
08x05,Unknown,Oprah wasn't built in a day.
08x05,Unknown,Uh-oh. What?
08x05,Unknown,I kind of went rogue.
08x05,Unknown,"Look, if you really want to have a baby, just stop taking the pill."
08x05,Unknown,You guys slept together at spring break three years ago.
08x05,Unknown,That means something.
08x05,Unknown,"Loves show tunes, total shopaholic, not always pestering you for sex?"
08x05,Unknown,"Um, Clifford sounds like a keeper."
08x05,Unknown,"Marshall, all of that advice was terrible."
08x05,Unknown,Not as terrible as you saying that Ted and Robin should stop being friends.
08x05,Unknown,I'm not saying they should. It would be horrible.
08x05,Unknown,But if Ted really wants to be with Victoria...
08x05,Unknown,"Ted, tell her that you're not gonna stop being friends with Robin."
08x05,Unknown,(sighs)
08x05,Unknown,I can't imagine life without Robin.
08x05,Unknown,But she'll never be in love with me.
08x05,Unknown,She'll never be my wife.
08x05,Unknown,She'll never be the person I grow old with.
08x05,Unknown,Victoria...
08x05,Unknown,Victoria could be.
08x05,Unknown,Are you saying what I think you're saying?
08x05,Unknown,You ready to say good-bye?
08x05,Unknown,Thanks for coming with me.
08x05,Unknown,"Oh, well, you did the same for me back when I had to give away all my dogs. Remember?"
08x05,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, we drove to your aunt's farm upstate."
08x05,Unknown,She was awesome.
08x05,Unknown,"Yeah. I love how she was this wise, old, chilled out, lesbian farmer."
08x05,Unknown,(laughs)
08x05,Unknown,"No, no, no. She's not a lesbian."
08x05,Unknown,Nor does she farm them.
08x05,Unknown,"No, that woman she lives with, that's just her special friend Maureen."
08x05,Unknown,They've lived together for...
08x05,Unknown,Oh.
08x05,(groaning),"Oh, this is gonna be tough."
08x05,Unknown,Brover really was the best wingman ever.
08x05,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
08x05,Unknown,Thank you so much for bringing Mr. Sprinkles back. Mr. Sprinkles... is a great name for a dog.
08x05,Unknown,Mommy missed you so much.
08x05,Unknown,"Yes, she did."
08x05,Unknown,Did this nice couple take care of you?
08x05,Unknown,(both stammering)
08x05,Unknown,That's a laugh. Ha.
08x05,(laughs),Big bro.
08x05,Unknown,"I got to split. Yeah, I got to, I got to head back to the farm... where I live with my special friend Maureen."
08x05,Unknown,Whom I now realize is my lesbian life partner.
08x05,Unknown,Surprise.
08x05,Unknown,Okay. All right.
08x05,Unknown,So... would you like a drink?
08x05,Unknown,Best wingman ever.
08x05,Unknown,Hey.
08x05,Unknown,What's all this?
08x05,Unknown,I thought you were mad at me.
08x05,Unknown,I was... but then I realized I just have to accept that you have close guy friends.
08x05,Unknown,"I mean, I don't want it becoming a habit that they steal you away from me in the middle of the night."
08x05,Unknown,But...
08x05,Unknown,(electronic chime)
08x05,Unknown,"Oh, sorry."
08x05,Unknown,"Oh, Ted needs to see me."
08x05,Unknown,"Oh, for the love of God, woman. Oh, it's not what you think. He just wants to have sex."
08x05,Unknown,Kidding.
08x05,Unknown,Just a little hand stuff.
08x05,Unknown,Ha. Kidding again.
08x05,Unknown,Ted's more of a boob man. I seriously can't stop.
08x05,Unknown,What does he want? Um...
08x05,Unknown,"I don't know, but he says it's urgent."
08x05,Unknown,I'm so sorry.
08x05,Unknown,Just one more little steal-away.
08x05,Unknown,Just as long as he gives you back.
08x05,Unknown,Thanks.
08x05,Unknown,So... are you okay?
08x05,Unknown,"What is this big, urgent thing that couldn't wait till tomorrow?"
08x05,Unknown,There's something I have to tell you.
08x05,Unknown,Um...
08x05,Unknown,"I've thought about this a ton, and, um..."
08x05,Unknown,"I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but..."
08x05,Unknown,"I'm not in love with Robin, um, but she's like family to me, and, uh..."
08x05,Unknown,I can't end that.
08x05,Unknown,So... can you accept that?
08x05,Unknown,I really hope you get her some day.
08x05,Unknown,"Hey, guys."
08x05,Unknown,Hey. Hey.
08x05,Unknown,"So, last night Ted calls me out to the bar to talk about something urgent."
08x05,Unknown,Guess what it was.
08x05,Unknown,He wants to write a series of young adult mystery novels called
08x05,Unknown,The Mosby Boys.
08x05,Unknown,Why did you need to tell me that?
08x05,Unknown,You work in the media. You know people.
08x05,Unknown,"Okay, well, first of all, lose the Mosby nerds and focus on that crime-solving squirrel."
08x05,Unknown,That guy is gold. Yeah.
08x05,Unknown,"And secondly, next time you have a big idea late at night, please bug your girlfriend about it."
08x05,Unknown,"Uh, actually..."
08x05,Unknown,Victoria and I broke up.
08x05,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
08x05,Unknown,"Why, what, what happened?"
08x05,Unknown,"We just, you know, wanted different things."
08x05,Unknown,"I'm so sorry, buddy."
08x05,Unknown,"But, bright side..."
08x05,Unknown,Robin is gonna be so touched when she hears you ended things with Victoria because of her.
08x05,Unknown,She can never know.
08x05,Unknown,Promise me Robin will never find out.
08x05,Unknown,I don't understand.
08x05,Unknown,Promise.
08x05,Unknown,Promise. Promise.
08x05,Unknown,Narrator
08x05,Unknown,"Of course, Robin did find out."
08x05,Unknown,But we'll get to that.
08x05,Unknown,(barks)
08x05,Unknown,So you do have balls?
08x05,Unknown,(barks)
08x05,Unknown,Run!
08x06,Unknown,Narrator
08x06,Unknown,"In the fall of 2012, Nick and Robin were going strong. Sometimes it's hard to say what it is exactly that makes a couple click."
08x06,Unknown,(sighs)
08x06,Unknown,Wow.
08x06,Unknown,(sighs)
08x06,Unknown,Bravissimo!
08x06,Unknown,"Whatever it was, kids, Nick and Robin really connected at first."
08x06,Unknown,"Hey, you know, I think I'm really starting to feel something here..."
08x06,Unknown,(snoring)
08x06,Unknown,"But then, as often happens, they started to drift apart."
08x06,Unknown,Why?
08x06,Unknown,Who can say?
08x06,Unknown,Nick and I haven't had sex in three days.
08x06,Unknown,And it's your fault.
08x06,Unknown,"Nick won't have sex because he pulled his groin muscle, all 'cause you made him join your stupid basketball team."
08x06,Unknown,"Did you say ""stupid basketball team""?"
08x06,Unknown,Yeah.
08x06,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh, guys, we have to rush Robin to the hospital."
08x06,Unknown,"Because somehow, she swallowed her vocal cords and they got lodged in her rectum,"
08x06,(whispers),because she's talking out of her ass.
08x06,Unknown,"Over the summer, Marshall had joined a midtown professionals basketball league."
08x06,Unknown,His team of lawyers was called The Force Majeurs.
08x06,Unknown,"Ever since they lost to a group of accountants, he'd started getting a little intense about it."
08x06,Unknown,"You sure you didn't have a ringer or two out there, Joel?"
08x06,Unknown,Don't know what you're talking about.
08x06,Unknown,"Good hustle out there, Aboubakar!"
08x06,Unknown,"If Joel can use ringers, then so can we."
08x06,Unknown,And Nick is our best player.
08x06,Unknown,"So as far as I'm concerned, you can both keep your groins on ice."
08x06,Unknown,Ted
08x06,,Groins on Ice.
08x06,Unknown,Least popular Madison Square Garden holiday show ever.
08x06,Unknown,Why are you so into this basketball league?
08x06,Unknown,"Robin, it's the Little Ivies Professionals Over 30"
08x06,Unknown,Who Work In Midtown League.
08x06,Unknown,It's The Show!
08x06,Unknown,(laughs)
08x06,Unknown,"You know, it's kind of funny, imagining people icing their groins."
08x06,Unknown,"I mean, first they'd be all cold, and then the ice would start to melt, and things would get all wet and... steamy."
08x06,Unknown,"Okay, Lily."
08x06,Unknown,"Look, buddy, I'm also the captain of a team in the Little Ivies Professionals Over 30"
08x06,Unknown,Who Work In Midtown League.
08x06,Unknown,"I'm addicted to the adrenaline, too."
08x06,Unknown,"Still, don't you think you're getting a little obsessive about..."
08x06,Unknown,Robin
08x06,,"Uh, hold up, hold up."
08x06,Unknown,Are you suggesting that you are a member of a sports team
08x06,Unknown,and
08x06,Unknown,you're the captain?
08x06,Unknown,"So says the ""C"""
08x06,Unknown,I personally sewed onto my jersey.
08x06,Unknown,"After Victoria and I broke up, I had some free time."
08x06,Unknown,"So, called up a few architect friends and put together a little team called the T-Squares."
08x06,Unknown,See that?
08x06,Unknown,The floor's uneven.
08x06,Unknown,And that window placement is rubbish.
08x06,Unknown,"You know, if a genie gave me one wish, I would knock down that wall and create a nice flow."
08x06,Unknown,Great wish.
08x06,Unknown,"I mean, there's too much hardwood, right?"
08x06,Unknown,Did you nerds actually play any basketball?
08x06,"Um, us nerds focused on something far more important",bonding.
08x06,Unknown,You guys are going to get pounded.
08x06,Unknown,And I am not.
08x06,Unknown,"Oh, come on. You can't go a couple weeks without sex?"
08x06,Unknown,"Our point guard's a 52-year-old virgin, happy as a clam."
08x06,Unknown,I'm sure he's quite a ball handler.
08x06,Unknown,"The problem is, now that we're not having sex, we're talking more, and I'm realizing that Nick is kind of... dumb."
08x06,Unknown,Really? News to me.
08x06,Unknown,I hadn't noticed that. No.
08x06,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
08x06,Unknown,"You guys think that he's dumb, too?"
08x06,Unknown,So dumb.
08x06,Unknown,Air bags are sharper.
08x06,Unknown,Hot as lava but just as thick.
08x06,Unknown,♪ How I Met Your Mother 8x06 ♪
08x06,Unknown,Splitsville
08x06,Unknown,"Original Air Date on November 12, 2012"
08x06,Unknown,Wow. When did you guys start to notice that he was kind of dumb?
08x06,Unknown,"Well, there was that time Nick was doing the crossword."
08x06,Unknown,"Hey, what's a four-"
08x06,Unknown,"letter word for cut? ""Nick."""
08x06,Unknown,Yeah?
08x06,Unknown,Is a four-letter word for cut.
08x06,Unknown,"What is? ""Nick."" What?"
08x06,Unknown,"Oh. I got it. ""Shave."""
08x06,Unknown,And there was the comment about Gypsies.
08x06,Unknown,"No, no."
08x06,Unknown,I think Gypsies prefer to be called Romani now.
08x06,Unknown,(laughs)
08x06,Unknown,Do they? Really?
08x06,Unknown,"And what do unicorns and, uh, elves and leprechauns prefer to be called?"
08x06,Unknown,(laughs)
08x06,Unknown,"You do know, uh, Gypsies are a real ethnic group that actually exists?"
08x06,Unknown,"Oh, you guys, I feel terrible now."
08x06,Unknown,"I always thought they were just made up, like goblins or trolls or dolphins."
08x06,Unknown,And then there's that story you told about how you and Nick picked up that Danish exchange student and you all took a shower together.
08x06,Unknown,I never told a story like that.
08x06,Unknown,"Well, no time like the present."
08x06,Unknown,Let's give this Danish ho a name.
08x06,Unknown,I'm thinking Nadia.
08x06,Unknown,"Yeah, she sounds slutty and bi-curious."
08x06,Unknown,What is wrong with you?
08x06,Unknown,Your kid is right there.
08x06,Unknown,Maybe want to clean it up a lit...
08x06,Unknown,(grunting)
08x06,Unknown,You're wearing a baby and you're doing pull-ups?
08x06,Unknown,"No, Ted, I'm sitting around getting soft, 'cause that's what champions do."
08x06,Unknown,"The problem is, now that I know how dumb Nick is, it's kind of making me reconsider the relationship."
08x06,Unknown,Why?
08x06,Unknown,"Eventually, Nick's groin will heal and you'll be back in Sexville, where all the crossword puzzles only have one box to fill."
08x06,Unknown,Talk about a double standard.
08x06,Unknown,"Every time I go after a busty dullard who can't tell time or thinks I'm the ghost of Leonardo DiCaprio, I'm shallow."
08x06,Unknown,But somehow it's okay for Robin to date a guy who can't be trusted around outlets.
08x06,Unknown,Dump him!
08x06,Unknown,"Okay, that is ridiculous."
08x06,Unknown,Is Nick a genius? No.
08x06,Unknown,But does he have average intelligence?
08x06,Unknown,No.
08x06,Unknown,"But he is a human being, with a heart!"
08x06,Unknown,"And you're afraid if I dump him, it'll throw off his game."
08x06,Unknown,"Robin, he got 36 points and 17 rebounds last week."
08x06,Unknown,And that was with his shoes on the wrong feet.
08x06,Unknown,(sighs)
08x06,Unknown,"Well, you're probably all wondering how the T-Squares' practice went today."
08x06,Unknown,The T-What?
08x06,Unknown,We played up here.
08x06,Unknown,"Basketball, people don't realize, is all geometry, physics and engineering."
08x06,Unknown,"If you think like an architect, you could win a thousand games without ever touching a ball."
08x06,Unknown,What happened to your ball?
08x06,Unknown,Some kids from the Hebrew school next door took it and wouldn't give it back.
08x06,(chuckles),Oh.
08x06,Unknown,Oy.
08x06,Unknown,Hey.
08x06,Unknown,"Hey. Hey. Oh, thanks."
08x06,Unknown,How'd the breakup with Nick go?
08x06,Unknown,Well...
08x06,Unknown,"So, I went to this fortune teller today and she said there was a curse on me."
08x06,Unknown,Did she sell you something to ward off the curse?
08x06,Unknown,"It's like you're a fortune teller, too."
08x06,Unknown,(sighs)
08x06,Unknown,"Nick, um..."
08x06,Unknown,I think we need to talk.
08x06,Unknown,Yeah.
08x06,Unknown,Uh... it's just...
08x06,Unknown,"Whoa, these are hard."
08x06,Unknown,"Anyway, this $500 bracelet will ward off evil till the end of the week, so..."
08x06,Unknown,"Do you think that you could do, uh, sit-ups or something while you talk?"
08x06,Unknown,Yeah.
08x06,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x06,Unknown,"Anyway, this fortune teller, she was able to tell me all sorts of stuff about my future, just from my credit cards and my social security number, I knew you'd cave."
08x06,Unknown,Which is why I came up with a little extra incentive to break up with Nick.
08x06,End it by 8,00 p.m. tonight or this invite goes live.
08x06,Unknown,(festive music playing over computer)
08x06,Unknown,"""Robin and Patrice's BFF Fun Day?!"""
08x06,Unknown,Narrator
08x06,Unknown,"Kids, Patrice was a coworker of Robin's who'd become sort of obsessed with her."
08x06,Unknown,"Robin had managed, until now, to keep Patrice at arms length."
08x06,Unknown,"But if Patrice were invited to something called Robin and Patrice's BFF Fun Day, she'd latch onto Robin and never let go."
08x06,Unknown,Why would you do that?
08x06,Unknown,Delete that right now!
08x06,Unknown,"No! If I don't give you a little push, you'll let this drag on until Nick can have sex again, and then you'll be right back to procrastinating on all fours."
08x06,Unknown,"I hate to admit it, but the man in the suit has a point."
08x06,Unknown,Ugh!
08x06,Unknown,"Fine, but the playoffs are coming up soon, and I can't have this guy an emotional wreck."
08x06,Unknown,"If you do dump him, at least let him down easy."
08x06,Unknown,"Yeah, take him to a nice restaurant."
08x06,Unknown,Preferably a dessert place.
08x06,Unknown,"That way, you won't have to sit through a whole meal before you get to..."
08x06,Unknown,Splitsville. Exactly.
08x06,Unknown,"No, Splitsville."
08x06,Unknown,It's a dessert place right around the corner.
08x06,Unknown,It's sort of
08x06,Unknown,the
08x06,Unknown,place to end a relationship.
08x06,Unknown,"Uh, Nick, listen."
08x06,Unknown,"You are awesome and totally sweet, but we're just not..."
08x06,Unknown,(sighs)
08x06,Unknown,"You know where I'm going with this, right?"
08x06,Unknown,No. No clue.
08x06,Unknown,"Okay, um..."
08x06,Unknown,I don't know if we should keep seeing each other.
08x06,Unknown,You want to start turning off the lights during sex?
08x06,Unknown,"No. God, no."
08x06,Unknown,No! No.
08x06,Unknown,"I am just worried that, as a couple, we're not working out."
08x06,Unknown,You want to start going to the gym together?
08x06,Unknown,"Okay, no, Nick, here is the deal."
08x06,Unknown,Okay...
08x06,Unknown,(cell phone rings)
08x06,Unknown,"Sorry, babe. I got to take this."
08x06,Unknown,Excuse me.
08x06,Unknown,Hello.
08x06,Unknown,"Hey, what's up?"
08x06,Unknown,You...
08x06,Unknown,What? I...
08x06,Unknown,I don't understand.
08x06,Unknown,But you...
08x06,Unknown,"Okay, um, you know what?"
08x06,Unknown,"I'm sorry, I-I have to go."
08x06,Unknown,What happened?
08x06,(sobs),I...
08x06,Unknown,"I, um..."
08x06,Unknown,"Uh, I'm sorry, I can't talk about this."
08x06,Unknown,(sniffles)
08x06,Unknown,(exhales heavily)
08x06,Unknown,"Anyway, what were you going to say?"
08x06,Unknown,Uh...
08x06,Unknown,"I was gonna say, order whatever else you want."
08x06,Unknown,It's on me.
08x06,Unknown,"Well, thanks, but I think I'd just rather eat it out of a bowl."
08x06,Unknown,"Well, no doubt you're all wondering how the T-Square's first game went."
08x06,Unknown,What Squares?
08x06,Unknown,Ted
08x06,,Picture a well-
08x06,Unknown,oiled machine.

08x06,Unknown,There were two seconds left on the clock.
08x06,Unknown,Aboubakar was all over me.
08x06,Unknown,And that's when all my years of architectural training came to my aid.
08x06,Unknown,I saw the space in a way my opponents never would.
08x06,Unknown,(buzzer sounds)
08x06,Unknown,Yes!
08x06,Unknown,I told you guys I'd make one of these!
08x06,Unknown,"Turns out, those two points were taken away because apparently the ball went ""out of bounds."""
08x06,Unknown,"But don't worry, I'm appealing to the league office."
08x06,Unknown,This Aboubakar-- I'm assuming you showered with the guy?
08x06,Unknown,Paint me a word picture.
08x06,Unknown,(cell phone rings)
08x06,Unknown,Hello.
08x06,Unknown,"Lil, is Barney there?"
08x06,Unknown,He's not answering his phone.
08x06,Unknown,"Mm, he's a little busy right now."
08x06,Unknown,It's Robin.
08x06,Unknown,37... 38...
08x06,Unknown,Put her on speaker. 39...
08x06,Unknown,When did you start being able to do stuff like this?
08x06,Unknown,"A few months ago, you had to catch your breath after making a sandwich."
08x06,Unknown,"Barney, delete the Robin and Patrice's BFF Fun Day invite!"
08x06,Unknown,Did you break up with Nick yet?
08x06,Unknown,I can't! He just got some horrible call.
08x06,Unknown,I think a family member might have died or something.
08x06,Unknown,Oh! Yes! Yes!
08x06,Unknown,Yes! Yes! Yes!
08x06,Unknown,"I mean, good that Robin can't dump him."
08x06,Unknown,"The death part, less good."
08x06,Unknown,"Robin, if you dump Nick, he could get mad and tear your blouse off."
08x06,Unknown,"And then he bites you on the neck, not super hard, just on the brink between pleasure and pain."
08x06,Unknown,And then that Danish sl*t Nadia bursts in...
08x06,Unknown,"You can't wait. His groin will heal and then before you know it, you'll be marrying a man who once ate a vanilla-scented candle!"
08x06,Unknown,That was on me.
08x06,Unknown,I shouldn't have left it in the kitchen.
08x06,Unknown,"Though, it was lit. Man, he dumb."
08x06,Unknown,The invite goes live in five minutes.
08x06,Unknown,What?!
08x06,Unknown,"It goes out automatically unless I stop it, and that only happens if I hear you dump Nick on speakerphone before then."
08x06,Unknown,Fine.
08x06,Unknown,"Hey, Nick. I'm sorry about that."
08x06,Unknown,"Um, listen, there's something I need to talk to you about."
08x06,Unknown,"No, Robin, I'm sorry. I'm like half here."
08x06,Unknown,"That phone call, it just..."
08x06,Unknown,I got some really bad news.
08x06,Unknown,My doctor did an MRI... and...
08x06,Unknown,"Oh... Oh, God. What, what is it?"
08x06,Unknown,My groin injury is worse than they thought.
08x06,Unknown,I can't play basketball for weeks.
08x06,Unknown,Thank God. I thought he was dying or something.
08x06,Unknown,How many weeks? How many weeks?!
08x06,Unknown,Please tell me it's not a tear in the iliolumbar ligament.
08x06,Unknown,"It's a tear in the ""libioflumflar linament."""
08x06,Unknown,"If it's a small tear, he can still make playoffs."
08x06,Unknown,It's a big tear.
08x06,Unknown,He better not be out for the season.
08x06,Unknown,I'm out for the season. Damn it!
08x06,Unknown,They're going up against The Number Crunchers without me.
08x06,Unknown,It's an after-work basketball league for lawyers and accountants and architects who sew.
08x06,Unknown,"I mean, who takes it that seriously?"
08x06,Unknown,No...!
08x06,Unknown,I just hate letting Coach Eriksen down.
08x06,Unknown,I would follow that man through the gates of hell!
08x06,Unknown,Winning.
08x06,Unknown,What do we win when we beat those Number Crunchers a few short weeks hence?
08x06,Unknown,A game? Sure.
08x06,Unknown,A trophy? Sort of.
08x06,Unknown,"We win a $25 gift card to Bennigan's, but what is it that we really win?"
08x06,Unknown,The game!
08x06,Unknown,"Yes, I said that Nick."
08x06,Unknown,Right.
08x06,Unknown,But we also win the right to walk tall.
08x06,Unknown,Oh!
08x06,Unknown,The right to call ourselves champions.
08x06,Unknown,Yeah. So we are gonna go out and we are gonna wipe the floor with those accountants!
08x06,Unknown,"And afterwards, we will feast like kings on Southwest Fajitas and Cajun shrimp!"
08x06,Unknown,"And that check, that check will be marginally less expensive!"
08x06,Unknown,Yeah! Yeah!
08x06,Unknown,"Now, they're probably gonna have to pay full price for that meal."
08x06,Unknown,(sighs)
08x06,Unknown,"Nick, you are so sweet, but I just..."
08x06,Unknown,"Good news is it doesn't really matter if it takes my groin pull a little longer to heal, so I may as well start having sex again."
08x06,Unknown,Listening.
08x06,Unknown,Sickening.
08x06,Unknown,Exiting.
08x06,Unknown,Nick... Huh?
08x06,Unknown,I just...
08x06,Unknown,Ah... I...
08x06,Unknown,Hmm? Um...
08x06,Unknown,Mm-hmm?
08x06,Unknown,Oh...
08x06,Unknown,What do you think?
08x06,Unknown,(moans)
08x06,Unknown,I think I am suddenly in the mood for something hot.
08x06,Unknown,I see. Sounds like I should order some cappuccinos.
08x06,Unknown,Don't talk till tomorrow morning.
08x06,Unknown,"She can't go home with you, Nick."
08x06,Unknown,Barney? Why not?
08x06,Unknown,Because Robin and I are in love.
08x06,Unknown,"Barney, what are you doing here?"
08x06,Unknown,Taking care of something you clearly can't do on your own.
08x06,Unknown,"I'm sorry, but you and Robin are done."
08x06,Unknown,"What? Robin, what is this?"
08x06,Unknown,"Barney, look, I-I know what you're doing, okay?"
08x06,Unknown,Please stop.
08x06,Unknown,"Robin doesn't want to hurt your feelings because you're a nice guy, but she thinks you're stupid and she hates you."
08x06,Unknown,You're welcome.
08x06,Unknown,Stop doing this.
08x06,Unknown,"I love her, Nick."
08x06,Unknown,"Look, he doesn't love me."
08x06,Unknown,He's just saying this because...
08x06,Unknown,"I love everything about her, and I'm not a guy who says that lightly."
08x06,Unknown,I'm a guy who has faked love his entire life.
08x06,Unknown,"I thought love was just something idiots thought they felt, but this woman has a hold on my heart that I could not break if I wanted to, and there have been times that I wanted to."
08x06,Unknown,"It has been overwhelming and humbling and even painful at times, but I could not stop loving her any more than I could stop breathing."
08x06,Unknown,"I am hopelessly, irretrievably in love with her."
08x06,Unknown,More than she knows.
08x06,Unknown,"Robin, is this true?"
08x06,Unknown,You heard him.
08x06,(voice breaking),"Oh, wow, it feels like I have a pulled groin muscle in my heart."
08x06,Unknown,"Nick, I-I'm so sorry."
08x06,Unknown,(sobbing) I just think that maybe...
08x06,(sobbing),Pardon me.
08x06,Unknown,But did you just also get your heart broken?
08x06,Unknown,Yes.
08x06,(sobbing),"I just got my heart broken, too!"
08x06,Unknown,"Well, do the... the two of you..."
08x06,Unknown,...want to come back to my place?

08x06,Unknown,"If all of 'em got it on-- Barney, Robin, Nick, and those two women, and you just know Nadia's watching in the corner with her pet snake."
08x06,Unknown,"Okay, why aren't you two having sex?"
08x06,Unknown,What?
08x06,Unknown,Excuse me?
08x06,Unknown,"Lily has been slobbering over Robin's sex life like a cartoon hobo watching a pie cool on a windowsill, and you--"
08x06,Unknown,the only other time you've ever exercised this seriously was when Lily had mono freshman year and I caught you doing one-armed push-ups with your genitals over a bowl of ice.
08x06,Unknown,"So, when did you stop doing it and why?"
08x06,Unknown,"It was, you know, before Marvin was born."
08x06,Unknown,What? Th-That's insane.
08x06,Unknown,"Well, you have to wait a while after having a kid, and, and then you're exhausted from being up all night."
08x06,Unknown,And then this uncanny phenomenon began.

08x06,Unknown,What are you doing?
08x06,Unknown,Taking Marvin for a walk so you guys can have some privacy.
08x06,Unknown,"Oh, Ted, come on, that's, that's just not the way that it works."
08x06,Unknown,"Yeah, it's not like we can have sex on cue."
08x06,Unknown,"Yeah, I'll give you guys plenty of time."
08x06,Unknown,"Maybe I'll even swing by the gym, show Marvin where his Uncle Ted made ""the shot."""
08x06,Unknown,"If I'm late, it's 'cause I've been delayed by autograph seekers."
08x06,Unknown,"Oh, forgot Marvin's diaper bag."

08x06,Unknown,You were this close to ripping off his misbuttoned shirt and pulling down his inside-out underpants.
08x06,Unknown,"I'll give you this, you were pretty convincing."

08x07,Unknown,I have to find a new strip club!
08x07,Unknown,I've been going to The Lusty Leopard for seven years.
08x07,Unknown,Wow. That's like
08x07,Unknown,49 in perv years.
08x07,Unknown,Sixty-nine. Self-five.
08x07,Unknown,"Look... without my open wallet, The Lusty Leopard would be nothing."
08x07,Unknown,"Thanks to me, they've been able to expand and take over that soup kitchen next door."
08x07,Unknown,"Now I'm a free agent, and all the strip clubs are after me."
08x07,Unknown,"Mr. Stinson, we might not have the best strippers at Moneyballs, but we use sabermetrics to get you a stripper with a five body, sure, and another with a butter face, but together, with their tireless grinding, we guarantee a high on-pants percentage."

08x07,Unknown,"Well, that's what everyone says... at first."

08x07,Unknown,"They've got maturity and experience, and the kind of mind-blowing flexibility that only comes from advanced hip dysplasia."
08x07,Unknown,"Barney, the Lusty Leopard would be lost without you."
08x07,Unknown,I think you're really gonna like a couple of the girls we just pulled up from the minors.
08x07,Unknown,Don't leave us!
08x07,Unknown,"Wow, you're like the LeBron James of strip clubs."
08x07,Unknown,"Actually, you're probably tied with LeBron James for that title."

08x07,Unknown,I'm not scared of him.
08x07,Unknown,It's totally normal to see a hot dog with a face.

08x07,Unknown,But my numerologist says roll the dice with the jury.
08x07,Unknown,"I'm waiting for my astrologist to weigh in, but he can be kind of flaky."
08x07,Unknown,"You know, Cancer."
08x07,Unknown,Should know more after he's back from chemo.
08x07,Unknown,(bell dings)
08x07,Unknown,"Good luck, bro!"
08x07,Unknown,You know the best part about you challenging me on Dishwalla?
08x07,Unknown,"Didn't challenge you, don't care. It made me dig up my old video diaries from freshman year."
08x07,Unknown,And somewhere in here there's gonna be proof that I am not a piggyback stamper.
08x07,Unknown,I have my own original ideas.
08x07,Unknown,Didn't you only do the video diaries because of Winona Ryder in
08x07,Unknown,Reality Bites?
08x07,Unknown,No.
08x07,Unknown,I don't know what you're talk-- shut up.
08x07,Unknown,Let's just watch.
08x07,Unknown,How do you even know there's gonna be mention of Dishwalla on those tapes? I don't.
08x07,Unknown,"And it may take me days to go through them all, but that is how committed I am to the truth."
08x07,Unknown,Lily
08x07,,"Hey, you guys should check out that song by the band Dishwalla."
08x07,Unknown,Ted
08x07,,Really? I've never heard of them.
08x07,Unknown,Damn it!
08x07,Unknown,So?
08x07,"Bottom line, Vito",a lot of strip clubs are into my client.
08x07,Unknown,"If you want the Melon Patch to be in the mix, we're gonna need bigger melons and smaller patches."
08x07,Unknown,"Otherwise, your establishment is not where Barney Stinson is gonna pitch his tent."
08x07,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x07,Unknown,"B-Dawg, Barn Door, Stinson-natti, Bro-hio!"
08x07,Unknown,Talk to me. How's it hangin'?
08x07,Unknown,You are k*lling it at this agent thing!
08x07,Unknown,I just got a big box at Yankee Stadium from the ladies at The Big Box.
08x07,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
08x07,One question,Golden Oldies just sent me a fax machine and a Charo calendar.
08x07,Unknown,Mm-hmm. Aren't they out of the running?
08x07,Unknown,"Yeah, but those old b*tches don't need to know that."
08x07,Unknown,"Yeah, I just feel kind of bad."
08x07,Unknown,They just spent eight grand on that wheelchair ramp up to the stage.
08x07,Unknown,"Hey, Larry, how's everything at the Beaver Dam?"
08x07,Unknown,I don't even know that strip club.
08x07,Unknown,"Oh, it's not a club."
08x07,Unknown,My cousin Larry is a forest ranger in Squamish.
08x07,Unknown,"Oh, yeah?"
08x07,Unknown,Then I was fired from Bed Bath & Beyond for telling inappropriate jokes.
08x07,Unknown,"I mean... get a sense of humor, LaShonda."
08x07,Unknown,"You know how ""they"" are. ""They"" meaning Bed Bath"
08x07,Unknown,"& Beyond employees, right?"
08x07,Unknown,Hmm?
08x07,Unknown,No. Women.
08x07,Unknown,That still could have been worse.
08x07,Unknown,Thank God I ran into Marshall.
08x07,Unknown,This guy's supportive as balls.
08x07,Unknown,And here I am.
08x07,Unknown,"Yes, we both owe Marshall a debt of gratitude for getting you this interview."
08x07,Unknown,Eriksen... can I see you outside? Sure.
08x07,Unknown,Good. Try to stay out there a few minutes.
08x07,Unknown,"I just cut one, and I can tell it's gonna be a slow burn."
08x07,Unknown,(clears throat)
08x07,Unknown,Ted
08x07,,What
08x07,Unknown,is
08x07,Unknown,Generation X?
08x07,Unknown,"What does the X in ""Generation X"" stand for?"
08x07,Unknown,What do
08x07,Unknown,we
08x07,Unknown,stand for?
08x07,Unknown,Why aren't people on campus talking about this?
08x07,Unknown,Maybe you should do a radio show and call yourself Dr. X.
08x07,Unknown,(laughing)
08x07,Unknown,I just had an amazing idea.
08x07,Unknown,(groans)
08x07,Unknown,Just turn it off!
08x07,Unknown,I can't look away.
08x07,Unknown,"Oh, God, no."
08x07,Unknown,"Oh, God, I'm putting on a beret."
08x07,Unknown,You were there.
08x07,Unknown,Why didn't you tell me that looked stupid?
08x07,Unknown,Lily
08x07,,"Ted, that beret looks stupid."
08x07,TED (French accent),I look
08x07,Unknown,magnifique
08x07,Unknown,!
08x07,Unknown,"Marshall, that man is the human equivalent of what came out of my body after eating that soup you recommended!"
08x07,Unknown,This guy's your friend?
08x07,Unknown,Really more of an acquaintance than a friend.
08x07,Unknown,(bell dings)
08x07,Unknown,No backpedaling.
08x07,Unknown,You're Marshall Eriksen.
08x07,Unknown,You believe in people.
08x07,Unknown,You know what Brad hasn't told you?
08x07,Unknown,He was third in our class at Columbia.
08x07,Unknown,That is impressive.
08x07,Unknown,And I suppose he did warn us about the fart.
08x07,Unknown,He's a great guy.
08x07,Unknown,Please... give him just one more chance.
08x07,Unknown,Two more minutes.
08x07,Unknown,(bell dings)
08x07,Unknown,I'm proud of you.
08x07,Unknown,I'm proud of you for being proud of me.
08x07,Unknown,(light ding)
08x07,Unknown,You went undergrad to Holy Cross?
08x07,Unknown,That's my alma mater.
08x07,Unknown,I went there on a basketball scholarship.
08x07,Unknown,No way. I played center.
08x07,Unknown,(scoffs)
08x07,Unknown,Uh-oh.
08x07,Unknown,"Why is that so shocking? 'Cause you're, like, an itty-bitty fella."
08x07,Unknown,"Hey, uh, fish, huh?"
08x07,Unknown,"Fish are crazy, right?"
08x07,Unknown,You guys ever think about fish?
08x07,Unknown,"I am six-foot one, sir."
08x07,Unknown,"Bro, I'm at least a foot taller than you."
08x07,Unknown,"Well, then I guess that makes you a freakish seven-foot one."
08x07,Unknown,"What do you call fish with no eyes? ""Fsh."""
08x07,Unknown,"I am six-feet and one inch, and I'll prove it."
08x07,Unknown,(snaps fingers)
08x07,Unknown,Eriksen.
08x07,Unknown,How tall are you?
08x07,Unknown,Seven feet.
08x07,Unknown,"So, we've got a deal somewhere?"
08x07,Unknown,We sure do.
08x07,Unknown,You are the new face of--
08x07,Unknown,and exclusive customer to...
08x07,Unknown,Golden Oldies!
08x07,Unknown,What?!
08x07,Unknown,I thought we ruled them out!
08x07,(high-pitched),I don't remember that!
08x07,Now let's go. It is 4,"00, and their dinner show starts in ten minutes."
08x07,Unknown,Wait a minute.
08x07,Unknown,Oh...
08x07,Unknown,Is that a Rolex?
08x07,Unknown,Huh. What do you know?
08x07,Unknown,How did that get there?
08x07,Unknown,"Anyway, uh, so initial here and..."
08x07,Unknown,"Where'd you get the bling, Robin?"
08x07,Unknown,Uh...
08x07,Unknown,They bribed you.
08x07,Unknown,They bribed you!
08x07,Unknown,Why else would you pick a place where the strippers say they're trying to put their grandkids through college?!
08x07,Unknown,Please leave!
08x07,Unknown,"Barney, I can explain, okay?"
08x07,Unknown,Please... leave.
08x07,Unknown,"Say it, you giant beast! Say I'm six-one!"
08x07,Unknown,Maybe if you stood on top of that pot of gold you have at the end of your rainbow.
08x07,Unknown,You know something?!
08x07,Unknown,You're nothing but a... a tree man!
08x07,Unknown,"I never want to see you again, tree man!"
08x07,Unknown,Fine.
08x07,Unknown,I have to go to the little boys' room.
08x07,Unknown,Not your office.
08x07,Unknown,I need to take a dump.
08x07,Unknown,"If that's the type of guy you vouch for, I can't trust your judgment."
08x07,Unknown,You're off the Gruber Pharmaceutical case.
08x07,Unknown,No...
08x07,Unknown,"Oh, good, we're up to the time I got my ear pierced."
08x07,(on video),"Do it, do it, do it, do it."
08x07,Unknown,"Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't, don't."
08x07,Unknown,"Okay, do it now. Do, do, do it, do it."
08x07,Unknown,"Don't, don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it!"
08x07,Unknown,"Don't! Yes, you can do this. You can..."
08x07,Unknown,That goes on for 45 minutes.
08x07,Unknown,"Hey... how was work, baby?"
08x07,Unknown,Remember how I always wanted to know what it was like to be a ghost?
08x07,Unknown,"Well, I don't want that anymore."
08x07,Unknown,"Okay, suppose we lead with the carbon testing of the residue water."
08x07,Unknown,How do we keep the jury engaged? Anyone?
08x07,Unknown,You could bring up the survey from Dr. Pasquesi's testimony.
08x07,Unknown,Anyone?
08x07,Unknown,Anyone who isn't dead to me?
08x07,Unknown,Then you have to earn Honeywell's trust back.
08x07,Unknown,Just start small.
08x07,Unknown,Put your stamp on little things that have nothing to do with work.
08x07,Unknown,Like a funny video.
08x07,Unknown,"I, uh, I may have something."
08x07,Unknown,Ted
08x07,,"Don't think, Mosby! Do it now! Oh, my God, I'm doing it!"
08x07,Unknown,"Wow, he's a real bleeder!"
08x07,Unknown,(bell dings)
08x07,Unknown,Lily
08x07,Unknown,"And then you build to something else small, like a tasty snack."
08x07,Unknown,Don't sleep on the popcorn.
08x07,Unknown,Try mixing the caramel and the cheese.
08x07,Unknown,"It shouldn't work, but... it... does."
08x07,Unknown,There's no way caramel and cheese... That's good!
08x07,Unknown,That is good. Oh!
08x07,Unknown,(bell dings)
08x07,Unknown,Lily
08x07,Unknown,"And when Honeywell starts trusting your stamp again, he'll seek out your opinion on things."
08x07,Unknown,"Be honest, Eriksen."
08x07,Unknown,Is this deep-V working?
08x07,Unknown,And that's when you lie your ass off.
08x07,Unknown,Sir...
08x07,Unknown,I think you could go even deeper.
08x07,Unknown,(bell dings)
08x07,Unknown,And before you know it...
08x07,Unknown,"Eriksen, get in here."
08x07,Unknown,...you're back on the case.
08x07,Unknown,"Ted, why are you torturing yourself?"
08x07,Unknown,None of us were our best in college.
08x07,Unknown,"Oh, my God, I love my hair there!"
08x07,Unknown,I always thought I was this kid from suburban Ohio who had this innate sense of judgment and taste and just showed up to college and wowed everyone.
08x07,Unknown,Now I have concrete proof that I wasn't.
08x07,Unknown,I was a total gomer.
08x07,Unknown,Maybe I still am.
08x07,Unknown,Wait-- that's the giant suit Marshall wore on our third date.
08x07,TED (on video),So...
08x07,Unknown,"Marshall Eriksen, you just came back from your third date with Lily."
08x07,Unknown,How was it?
08x07,Unknown,"Great, yeah."
08x07,Unknown,I just... I think I'm falling for this girl pretty hard.
08x07,Unknown,But is everything happening too fast?
08x07,Unknown,"I mean, maybe I should see other people."
08x07,Unknown,"Whoa, dude, no!"
08x07,Unknown,Lily Aldrin is special. You hold on to that girl.
08x07,Unknown,Marshall
08x07,,She is.
08x07,Unknown,I'm only 18 and...
08x07,Unknown,"Marshall, you being 18"
08x07,Unknown,isn't a bad thing.
08x07,Unknown,It just means you get to spend even more of your life with her.
08x07,Unknown,"I mean, I'm probably not gonna meet my wife until I'm, like, 23."
08x07,Unknown,You're right.
08x07,Unknown,What am I thinking?
08x07,Unknown,I'm in love with this girl.
08x07,Unknown,"Ted, oh, my God."
08x07,Unknown,You gave me the ultimate stamp.
08x07,Unknown,"And in my whole life, this life... it all goes back to that moment."
08x07,TED (on video),"I mean, maybe take a month off, bang a couple chicks."
08x07,Unknown,Lily's not going anywhere.
08x07,Unknown,"Hey, Barney. Hey."
08x07,Unknown,"Um, look, I'm sorry about the whole skimming-off-the-top-"
08x07,Unknown,of-the-strip-club-swag thing.
08x07,Unknown,"Hey, it happens to everybody."
08x07,Unknown,"Really? Because even as I said those words, they did not feel like a real thing."
08x07,Unknown,"Hey, look, wherever you end up, can I have the dubious honor of buying you your first lap dance?"
08x07,Unknown,It's a date.
08x07,Unknown,"Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for ""The Decision."""
08x07,Unknown,(boombox plays fanfare)
08x07,Unknown,Yeah.
08x07,Unknown,"Ladies, my bro-dium?"
08x07,Unknown,Yeah. (chuckles)
08x07,Unknown,Look at this!
08x07,Unknown,"Man, this whole free agent experience, it's been an unbelievable experience, a real humbling experience."
08x07,Unknown,"First of all, The Lusty Leopard is where I developed my game."
08x07,Unknown,Oh...
08x07,(voice breaks),I have nothing but the utmost respect for you skanks.
08x07,Unknown,He's just gonna stay at The Lusty Leopard.
08x07,Unknown,They have loyalty and heart.
08x07,Unknown,I bet you he rewards that.
08x07,Unknown,"LeBron moved on, Ted. So should you."
08x07,Unknown,But Barney Stinson has to do what's right for Barney Stinson's penis.
08x07,Unknown,In this fall... This is tough.
08x07,Unknown,Um... in this fall I'm going to take my talents to Mouth Beach.
08x07,Unknown,Narrator
08x07,Unknown,"The next day, Uncle Marshall went to court for the biggest case of his life."
08x07,Unknown,"Hey, Marshall! Bilbo!"
08x07,Unknown,Brad? What are you...?
08x07,Unknown,Did you just get hired by Gruber Pharmaceutical's legal team?
08x07,Unknown,"Oh, not just."
08x07,Unknown,I've been working for them for two years.
08x07,Unknown,"I heard about the job opening at Honeywell & Cootes and knew that if I hung out in front of your office and pretended to be down on my luck, you'd take pity on me, get me an interview..."
08x07,Unknown,Try to stay out there a few minutes.
08x07,Unknown,"I just cut one, and I can tell it's gonna be a slow burn."
08x07,Unknown,...and buy some alone time in the conference room.
08x07,Unknown,I got your firm's strategy for the case.
08x07,Unknown,"Muchas gracias, bro-migo."
08x07,Unknown,He's really more of an acquaintance than a bro-migo.
08x07,Unknown,"Win this case or you're fired, Eriksen."
08x07,Unknown,Narrator
08x07,Unknown,And so began the trial that would change the course of Marshall's career.
08x07,Unknown,But we'll get to that.
08x07,"Oh, you see?! This is what I miss about being single","cutting loose at a strip club, drinkin' some beers, seein' some boobs, getting thrown out for being ""too handsy."""
08x07,Unknown,You were a little out of control tonight.
08x07,Unknown,"You know, I really thought that that bouncer was bluffing with the Taser."
08x07,Unknown,"Man, everything's gonna taste like pennies for a week."
08x07,Unknown,"I had a fun time tonight, though."
08x07,Unknown,"Me, too."
08x07,Unknown,I always have fun with you.
08x07,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x07,Unknown,"Whoa, whoa."
08x07,Unknown,I-I've got to... um...
08x07,Unknown,"We can't, we can't do this."
08x07,Unknown,(stammers)
08x07,Unknown,"This, this can't happen."
08x07,Unknown,"Uh, I've got to go. What...?"
08x08,Unknown,Narrator
08x08,Unknown,"Kids, this a story about the time your Uncle Marshall went before the New York State Judiciary Committee, a panel that would decide the fate of his career. He thought he'd open with an icebreaker."
08x08,Unknown,"By the way, did I mention those robes really do you all... justice?"
08x08,Unknown,I'm just saying that you're all guilty... of looking sharp.
08x08,Unknown,"Mr. Eriksen, please."
08x08,Unknown,"You're here to discuss your conduct in court during the week of November 19, 2012."
08x08,Unknown,"Of course, Your Honor."
08x08,Unknown,It all started when...
08x08,Unknown,"a so-called friend from law school conned me into believing that he needed my help getting a job, when in reality, he stole my firm's strategy for our upcoming trial against Gruber Pharmaceuticals, who'd been polluting a lake upstate."
08x08,Unknown,"Turns out, he was representing Gruber."
08x08,Unknown,"Win this case or you're fired, Eriksen."
08x08,Unknown,How could you trick me like that?
08x08,Unknown,This is the biggest trial in my career.
08x08,Unknown,"Mine too, brobeans."
08x08,Unknown,"When I win this trial, I'm gonna buy a new car."
08x08,Unknown,Thinking Lambo.
08x08,Unknown,"Awesome. I mean, no!"
08x08,Unknown,What happened to you?
08x08,Unknown,"You used to be, like, the nicest guy ever."
08x08,Unknown,We were bros.
08x08,Unknown,More than bros.
08x08,Unknown,We ate brunch together.
08x08,Unknown,And I'll always cherish that.
08x08,Unknown,"But after Kara broke my heart again for the millionth time, I said screw being nice, suited up and started lying to get what I want."
08x08,Unknown,That does happen.
08x08,Unknown,But you used to want to fight for the little guy.
08x08,Unknown,Little guys pay with little checks.
08x08,Unknown,But... you already know that.
08x08,Unknown,You're in environmental law.
08x08,Unknown,"Marshall, you have a kid."
08x08,Unknown,How are you gonna provide for the little dude's futche?
08x08,Unknown,I'm worried about Planet Earth's futche!
08x08,Unknown,That's why I'm gonna kick your ass in this trial.
08x08,Unknown,"Sure, you may have swiped our entire strategy for this case, but I still got some tricks up my sleeve that you know absolutely nothing about."
08x08,Unknown,Really?
08x08,Unknown,No.

08x08,Unknown,"Oh, great. Good to see you! You, too!"
08x08,Unknown,They pretended it never happened.
08x08,Unknown,"All right, guys, this is the biggest case of Marshall's career."
08x08,Unknown,"That is why it's so great that we all called in sick to work tomorrow, so we could be in that courtroom to support him."
08x08,Unknown,I didn't call in sick.
08x08,Unknown,I called in for all of us.
08x08,Unknown,"Uh, I have strep throat."
08x08,Unknown,"Robin, bronchitis."
08x08,Unknown,"Barney, massive hemorrhoids."
08x08,Unknown,"Why'd you have to say ""massive""?"
08x08,Unknown,"Well, if you're gonna miss work for hemorrhoids, they kind of have to be massive."
08x08,Unknown,I don't want to sit in a courtroom all day.
08x08,Unknown,I bet you don't want to sit anywhere with those hemorrhoids.
08x08,Unknown,I don't have... Shut up.
08x08,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x08,Unknown,"Look, you guys wouldn't understand, but when you have a rap sheet as long as mine, the last place you want to spend a day is in court."
08x08,Unknown,Rap sheet?
08x08,Unknown,That's right.

08x08,Unknown,That's probably why I never have felt the need to do dr*gs or rebel in any way.
08x08,Unknown,(laughs)
08x08,Unknown,Anyhoo...
08x08,Unknown,(sighs)
08x08,Unknown,Narrator
08x08,Unknown,"The next day, we all headed down to court to support Uncle Marshall."
08x08,Unknown,Yeah.
08x08,Unknown,Want to know what I looked like at age 15?
08x08,Unknown,There it is.
08x08,Unknown,I don't get it. That guy wasn't masturbating.
08x08,Unknown,"Yeah, and the waistband of his undies wasn't pulled up to his Cub Scouts neckerchief."
08x08,Unknown,(chuckling)
08x08,Unknown,Lily
08x08,,"Ted, you were never a badass."
08x08,Unknown,Au contraire.
08x08,Unknown,Off to a good start...
08x08,Unknown,I was locked up plenty of times as a teenager.
08x08,Unknown,Let's just say Johnny Law was not a fan of Teddy Westside.
08x08,Unknown,Make sure you get my good side...
08x08,Unknown,Princess.
08x08,Unknown,(camera shutter clicks)
08x08,Unknown,You guys want to talk about hassling the fuzz?
08x08,Unknown,"Finish that, Scoots."
08x08,Unknown,"Okay, let's see some IDs."
08x08,Unknown,"Scooter, do you smell bacon?"
08x08,Unknown,(laughs sinisterly)
08x08,Unknown,"Laugh, b*tch."
08x08,Unknown,Ha!
08x08,Unknown,Ha ha!
08x08,Unknown,"ID now, both of you."
08x08,Unknown,(sighs)
08x08,Unknown,Which one of you is Yuki Hakutani?
08x08,Unknown,Right here.
08x08,Unknown,"So, Yuki, you're 6'1"" and you were born in 1947?"
08x08,Unknown,Congratulations. You can read.
08x08,Unknown,(screaming)
08x08,Unknown,Barney Stinson?
08x08,Unknown,"Well, if it isn't Warren Frankel."
08x08,Unknown,Bailiff
08x08,"Warren Frankel, who knows me. FRANKEL","You know, I almost didn't recognize you without handcuffs on."
08x08,Unknown,"Yeah, I've matured quite a bit since the old days."
08x08,Unknown,"The only time I'm wearing handcuffs now is, uh, in the bedroom."
08x08,Unknown,Bondage. I get it.
08x08,Unknown,"Well, I have to run."
08x08,Unknown,Stay out of trouble.
08x08,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x08,Unknown,Badass.
08x08,Unknown,"In summary, I will prove that Gruber Pharmaceuticals wantonly and knowingly polluted Frog Lake and therefore must pay restitution of no less than $25 million."
08x08,Unknown,Thank you.
08x08,How's this for a fact,Frog Lake is home to a buttload of frogs and birds.
08x08,Unknown,"If it's so polluted, why don't all those birds fly to a cleaner lake?"
08x08,Unknown,"And why don't the frogs just be like, ""Hey, birds, can I catch a ride, ribbit?"""
08x08,(quietly),Marshall's gonna wipe the floor with this ding-dong.
08x08,Unknown,Oops.
08x08,Unknown,I seem to have dropped my pen.
08x08,Unknown,"Objection, Your Honor."
08x08,Unknown,Nobody needs this long to pick up a pen.
08x08,Unknown,I'll allow it.
08x08,Unknown,The biggest case of my life and I'd already lost the jury.
08x08,Unknown,"I mean, I've heard of"
08x08,Unknown,"Twelve Angry Men,"
08x08,Unknown,but this was more like
08x08,Unknown,Twelve Horny Women.
08x08,Unknown,Stay on topic.
08x08,Unknown,I can't compete with Brad.
08x08,Unknown,The jury is in love with him.
08x08,Unknown,"During recess, one of those ladies raced across the hall to see if she could get a divorce."
08x08,Unknown,And I'm pretty sure there was some funny business going on under that judge's robe.
08x08,Unknown,What you guys saw Brad do was nothing.
08x08,Unknown,He's taken it to a whole other level.
08x08,Unknown,"Ladies and... ladies of the jury, I'm sorry if I seem down."
08x08,Unknown,My girlfriend Kara... broke up with me last night.
08x08,Unknown,JURY
08x08,,Aww...
08x08,Unknown,"She said I listen too much, whatever that means."
08x08,Unknown,JURY
08x08,,Aww... Aww...
08x08,Unknown,Can you believe this guy?
08x08,Unknown,Really?
08x08,Unknown,Do I even want to see what I look like?
08x08,Unknown,Wow.
08x08,Unknown,"That's, like, super mean."
08x08,Unknown,"Next, Brad brought out his ""expert witness."""
08x08,Unknown,"So, Dr. Bedrosian, you're saying that even if Gruber Pharmaceuticals' industry-leading dr*gs somehow seeped into Frog Lake, they could actually be helping the otter population grow"
08x08,Unknown,thicker
08x08,Unknown,coats of fur?
08x08,Unknown,Absolutely.
08x08,Unknown,"And for the older birds, who... maybe don't perform as well in the bedroom as they used to, could actually be having healthier sex lives?"
08x08,Unknown,In my expert opinion... yes...?
08x08,Unknown,Yes.
08x08,Unknown,So Gruber... is giving these animals free medicine.
08x08,Unknown,Medicine that you or I would have to pay a fortune for if... we needed help in the bedroom... which I don't.
08x08,Unknown,(jury giggling)
08x08,Unknown,You're so bad.
08x08,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x08,Unknown,"But I realized, if Brad could call a quack as his star witness, then so could I."
08x08,Unknown,You'll get that in a second.
08x08,Unknown,(duckling peeping)
08x08,Unknown,"Meet Paddles, the duckling. ""Quack."""
08x08,Unknown,Continue.
08x08,Unknown,Little Paddles here just spent three months being nursed back to health.
08x08,Unknown,Why?
08x08,Unknown,"Well, because he was found in Frog Lake suffering from acute dermatitis..."
08x08,Unknown,(jury gasps)
08x08,Unknown,"...a painful full-body rash, caused by who?"
08x08,Unknown,Gruber Pharmaceuticals.
08x08,Unknown,(jury gasps)
08x08,Unknown,"For a brief, shining moment, it looked like I might just win this thing."
08x08,Unknown,But then...
08x08,Unknown,"I took a field trip to this so-called ""polluted"" lake."
08x08,Unknown,"If you'll indulge me, I'd like to share my experience."
08x08,Unknown,(sultry saxophone playing)
08x08,Unknown,BRAD
08x08,,Frog Lake.
08x08,Unknown,Behold... nature's beauty.
08x08,Unknown,Polluted?
08x08,Unknown,Polluted with good times.
08x08,Unknown,♪
08x08,Unknown,Frog... Lake.
08x08,Unknown,♪
08x08,Unknown,♪
08x08,Unknown,♪
08x08,Unknown,Frog Lake.
08x08,Unknown,Come on in.
08x08,Unknown,The water's fine.
08x08,Unknown,(bell dings)
08x08,Unknown,I shot and edited that myself.
08x08,Unknown,(quiet laugh)
08x08,Unknown,"Yep, I edit stuff, too."
08x08,Unknown,"Sorry, Ms. Aldrin, there's no rap sheet under your name."
08x08,"Oh, y-you know what, it must be under my street tag",Number One Gunna.
08x08,Unknown,"Nope. Sorry, Number One Gunna."
08x08,Unknown,Next!
08x08,Unknown,Those jive-ass turkeys must've lost it.
08x08,Unknown,"Well, they're pretty swamped arresting 1970s pimps like yourself."
08x08,Unknown,"Lily, let it go."
08x08,Unknown,"I didn't want to brag, but I think it's time to acknowledge that"
08x08,Unknown,I
08x08,Unknown,was the ultimate teenage badass of this group.
08x08,Unknown,(laughing)
08x08,Unknown,You were a teen pop star in Canada.
08x08,Unknown,You sang songs about the mall. Hey.
08x08,Unknown,There is a dark side to being a rocker on the road north of the 49th.
08x08,Unknown,(rock music playing)
08x08,Unknown,(knocking)
08x08,Unknown,"Mm, thanks."
08x08,Unknown,Hey.
08x08,Unknown,"We've received some noise complaints, eh?"
08x08,Unknown,Can you please lower the music?
08x08,Unknown,"Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure."
08x08,(scoffs),Sure.
08x08,Unknown,"How aboot, uh, I lower the TV, too, yeah?"
08x08,Unknown,(grunts)
08x08,Unknown,(screeches)
08x08,Unknown,(cheering)
08x08,Unknown,"Three hours later, I was arrested drunk, naked, and driving a Zamboni."
08x08,Unknown,"Man, that DUI drove my insurance through the roof."
08x08,Unknown,JUDGE
08x08,,Please be seated.
08x08,Unknown,"Mr. Morris, good seeing you this morning."
08x08,Unknown,Mr. Eriksen... you're here.
08x08,Unknown,"Any, uh, final witnesses?"
08x08,Unknown,"Well, Your Honor, um..."
08x08,Unknown,Um...
08x08,Unknown,"Actually, Your Honor, uh, I'm afraid..."
08x08,Unknown,JUDGE
08x08,,Mr. Eriksen?
08x08,Unknown,"Your Honor, I call Brad Morris to the stand."
08x08,Unknown,(excited chatter)
08x08,Unknown,"Mr. Eriksen, this is highly irregular. I would like Mr. Morris to remove his shirt."
08x08,Unknown,JUDGE
08x08,,"I'll allow it. Objection, Your Honor, on grounds that this is ridonk!"
08x08,Unknown,Overruled. Take it off.
08x08,Unknown,(exhales)
08x08,Unknown,(jury groaning)
08x08,Unknown,"Acute... dermatitis, courtesy of Frog Lake and Gruber Pharmaceuticals."
08x08,Unknown,(exhales)
08x08,Unknown,That was badass.
08x08,Unknown,"So, in the end, one might say you were forced to do something... rash?"
08x08,Unknown,(laughter)
08x08,Unknown,Rash!
08x08,Unknown,"You know, I had that one, but Lily told me to cut it."
08x08,Unknown,"Um, anyway... all that was left was the verdict."
08x08,Unknown,(paper unfolding)
08x08,Unknown,"""We, the jury, find Gruber Pharmaceuticals... guilty."""
08x08,Unknown,(excited shouts)
08x08,Unknown,Yes!
08x08,(whispers),$25 million.
08x08,Unknown,That tie is not only tasteful; it's lucky!
08x08,Unknown,"I hereby fine Gruber in the amount of $25,000."
08x08,Unknown,Court is adjourned.
08x08,Unknown,"Your Honor, $25,000? What just happened?"
08x08,Unknown,"Son, yes, Gruber Pharmaceuticals probably polluted that lake, but I'm not gonna ruin an important company just because they gave some bird a rash."
08x08,Unknown,"No, but it's thousands of birds, and fish and otters and turtles... Look, Eriksen, I hate to cut you short, but I got tickets to"
08x08,Unknown,Annie
08x08,Unknown,and my wife is waiting.
08x08,Unknown,You have a wi... won-wonderful show to see?
08x08,Unknown,Guilty. Ciao.
08x08,(deep voice),"You'd best get your mind right, son!"
08x08,Unknown,"The game is the game, and there ain't no winners."
08x08,Unknown,How many retired gangbangers you know?
08x08,Unknown,Exactly.
08x08,Unknown,(all shrieking)
08x08,(chuckling),Barney... check it out.
08x08,Unknown,I found my scrapbook from the old days.
08x08,Unknown,"We're kind of busy right now, Warren."
08x08,Unknown,"We're scaring kids straight, so..."
08x08,Unknown,"No, no. Barney was the youngest member of our Magic Enthusiasts Club years back."
08x08,Unknown,Famous for escaping from handcuffs.
08x08,Unknown,"Handcuffs, huh?"
08x08,Unknown,Very tiny hands.
08x08,Unknown,That was his secret.
08x08,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x08,Unknown,"See you around, baby hands."
08x08,Unknown,"So, you don't know the bailiff because you were a badass."
08x08,Unknown,You knew him because you guys were in a nerd club together.
08x08,Unknown,Where you dazzled audiences with your sleight-of-tiny-hand.
08x08,Unknown,So I was a late hand bloomer!
08x08,"Go ahead, laugh, laugh like all the others, but those magicians pulled off the greatest trick of all",(voice breaking): they accepted me.
08x08,Unknown,"Okay, well, to be fair, I... may have slightly exaggerated my badass story, too."
08x08,Unknown,(knocking)
08x08,Unknown,"Oh, sorry. Uh, no, thank you, housekeeping."
08x08,Unknown,I've already made my bed.
08x08,Unknown,"And I only used one washcloth, so it's..."
08x08,Unknown,"Congratulations, Miss Sparkles."
08x08,Unknown,"On behalf of the Manitoba Hotel and Curling Rink Association, we'd like to thank you for being the nicest, most well-behaved hotel guest ever."
08x08,(laughing),"Oh, yippee!"
08x08,(laughs),What a loser!
08x08,Unknown,"Your story's not true, either, is it, Ted?"
08x08,Unknown,Not at all.
08x08,Unknown,"Make sure you get my good side, Princess!"
08x08,Unknown,(camera shutter clicks)
08x08,Unknown,"I left the courthouse that day questioning what I was even doing with my life... and then that night, I had a dream."
08x08,Unknown,"Sorry I failed, son."
08x08,Unknown,"What about your Pebble Theory, Dad?"
08x08,Unknown,One good deed ripples out and makes another and another?
08x08,Unknown,Yeah.
08x08,Unknown,This is what really happens when you throw a pebble into Frog Lake.
08x08,Unknown,(whoosh)
08x08,Unknown,"The truth is, you can fight your whole life to do good and still get nowhere."
08x08,Unknown,You're wrong.
08x08,Unknown,"Some good's gonna ripple out of this, Dad."
08x08,Unknown,I promise.
08x08,Unknown,(creature screeches)
08x08,Unknown,"Great, I've angered the Frog King."
08x08,Unknown,"Later that night, some good did ripple out."
08x08,Unknown,(footsteps approaching)
08x08,Unknown,BRAD
08x08,,Hey.
08x08,Unknown,"What, are you here to gloat?"
08x08,(sighs),No. Came here to thank you.
08x08,For reminding me of why I got into law in the first place,to fight for the little guy.
08x08,Unknown,Which is why I said
08x08,Unknown,"""Hasta Lucia"""
08x08,Unknown,"to my firm, and took a job at your firm, brobeans."
08x08,Unknown,"Don't ""brobeans"" me."
08x08,Unknown,My boss would never hire you after the way you lied to us.
08x08,Unknown,"I told him I'd take every last bit of manipulation, deception, and accidental pen-dropping I used against you guys and put it towards saving the world."
08x08,Unknown,"Even if that's true, I'm still not sure that I can forgive you."
08x08,Would you object to an 11,15 brunch rezzy for two tomorrow at the Popover Pantry?
08x08,Unknown,I'll allow it.
08x08,Unknown,Yes! The Brunch Bros are back!
08x08,Unknown,"And thank God we were, because... well, what he said next is the reason that I'm sitting in this chair."
08x08,Unknown,"Seriously, thanks-- for giving my soul a little redempsh."
08x08,Unknown,"And B-T-dubs, that judge was an idiot."
08x08,Unknown,"It's people like you, people with hope and vision and integ, that should be behind that bench making the calls."
08x08,Unknown,And that's when I realized I wanted to be a judge.
08x08,Unknown,Because judges are the ones who can effect real change.
08x08,Unknown,"And that's why I'm here, before the New York State Judiciary Committee."
08x08,Unknown,I hope that you will consider me for an appointment to a judgeship.
08x08,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr. Eriksen."
08x08,Unknown,The panel will take this under advisement.
08x08,Unknown,Take your time.
08x08,Unknown,It could be a few months.
08x08,Unknown,Better tell my wife I won't be home for dinner.
08x08,Unknown,Get out.
08x08,Unknown,(sighs)
08x08,Unknown,Hey.
08x08,Unknown,Hey.
08x08,Unknown,"How are you? Uh, great. You?"
08x08,Unknown,So gr... (sighs)
08x08,Unknown,Can we talk about this for a second?
08x08,Unknown,Yeah.
08x08,Unknown,"It is super-weird between us, and I don't want it to be."
08x08,Unknown,"Me, neither."
08x08,Unknown,So let me just say this.
08x08,Unknown,I'm done.
08x08,Unknown,You don't have to worry anymore.
08x08,Unknown,What do you mean?
08x08,Unknown,I'm done trying to get you.
08x08,Unknown,I can't do it anymore.
08x08,Unknown,"I'm sorry it's taken me this long to figure it out, but I promise..."
08x08,Unknown,I'm done making a fool of myself.
08x08,Unknown,"Barney, you haven't been making a fool out of yourself..."
08x08,Unknown,It's okay.
08x08,Unknown,It's okay.
08x08,Unknown,I want it to be okay.
08x08,Unknown,So here's what's gonna happen.
08x08,Unknown,"I'm gonna get us two drinks, come back and comment on the likely size and color of the nipples on that redhead at the bar, with the big, dark nipples."
08x08,Unknown,"And you're gonna be grossed out, but you're gonna laugh a little anyway, and then you'll tell a funny story about ""that b*tch Patrice"" at work, but neither one of us are gonna say, ""Hey, how's it going?"" or ""Good to see you!"""
08x08,Unknown,Because it really will be good to see you.
08x08,Unknown,Think we can swing that?
08x08,Unknown,"Yeah, I do."
08x08,Unknown,Badass.
08x08,Unknown,(laughs)
08x08,Unknown,Huh.
08x08,Unknown,"Thanks for your support, guys. It means a lot."
08x08,Unknown,We'll call in sick anytime you have a problem.

08x09,Unknown,"Well, it's come to this-- we're drinking with our baby in a bar."
08x09,Unknown,It is not a bar.
08x09,Unknown,It's a restaurant that happens to have a bar.
08x09,Unknown,"Ergo, we are good parents."
08x09,Unrelated,I'm getting faced right now.
08x09,Unknown,Papa needs a grease coat.
08x09,Unknown,Ted

08x09,Unknown,"If you guys want, I'm free to watch Marvin."
08x09,Unknown,"I'm meeting with a headhunter next week to line up my next project, but until then, what the hell?"
08x09,Unknown,"Ted, although a ""what the hell"" attitude is incredibly sought after in a babysitter, I think that Lily and Marshall..."
08x09,Unknown,Both
08x09,,You're hired.
08x09,Unknown,"Now that we've been parents for awhile, we realize that pretty much any moron can take care of a baby."
08x09,Unknown,Thank you.
08x09,Unknown,Mine!
08x09,Unknown,Ow.
08x09,Unknown,Delicious and mine.

08x09,Unknown,"They do look yummy yum-yum, mister."
08x09,Unknown,(giggles)
08x09,Unknown,No. No!
08x09,Unknown,What have I done?!
08x09,Unknown,"I am so sorry, Cornelius."
08x09,Unknown,You deserve a better end than this!
08x09,Unknown,You got ketchup on a red tie.
08x09,Unknown,You can't even see it.

08x09,Unknown,I'm going in.
08x09,Unknown,(blowing)
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, my..."
08x09,Unknown,"Damn it, guys, we lost him."
08x09,Unknown,And he was so close to retirement.
08x09,Unknown,"Just this morning he said to me, ""I'm getting too old for this shirt."""

08x09,Unknown,(giggles)
08x09,Unknown,Robin...
08x09,Unknown,...let's go hit the bar.
08x09,Unknown,At this restaurant.
08x09,Unknown,I think they have a bar here.
08x09,Unknown,"Okay, what was that? What was what?"
08x09,Unknown,"The ""dumb cheerleader flirting with the quarterback"" thing."
08x09,Unknown,You looked like you were gonna chase Barney down with a sixer of watermelon wine coolers.
08x09,Unknown,"First of all, those bad girls come in fourskis."
08x09,Unknown,"And second, why would I be flirting with Barney?"
08x09,Unknown,"I'm not interested in him, and I made that very clear."
08x09,Unknown,With something that I did.
08x09,Unknown,Recently.
08x09,Unknown,Just spill it.
08x09,Unknown,Robin
08x09,Unknown,"The other week, Barney made a move, but I turned him down."
08x09,Unknown,"I felt awful for closing the door in his face, but he realized I was right."
08x09,Unknown,I'm done trying to get you.
08x09,Unknown,I can't do it anymore.
08x09,Unknown,And now I get it. Get what?
08x09,Unknown,"You may have closed the door on Barney, but he locked it."
08x09,Unknown,"What? No, he didn't."
08x09,Unknown,"Yeah, he got the last word, and now you want what you can't have, like you always do."
08x09,Unknown,It's the classic lobster situation.
08x09,Unknown,I'm afraid you're allergic to lobster.
08x09,Unknown,"You can never, ever, ever have it."
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, this... is... delicious."
08x09,Unknown,"Once you learned you couldn't have lobster, you became obsessed."
08x09,Unknown,Barney's the same thing.
08x09,Unknown,"And this is gonna blow up in your face, just like the lobster blew up your face."
08x09,Unknown,Wrong. This is nothing like lobster.
08x09,Unknown,Okay.
08x09,Unknown,"Just remember, you can never hook up with Barney again."
08x09,Unknown,That's fine. Never.

08x09,Unknown,"Oh, no."
08x09,Unknown,"Marshall, Lily and Ted can't make it, for viable reasons I just learned via this text message I accidentally deleted."
08x09,Unknown,Guess it's just gonna be you and me.
08x09,Unknown,Fine by me.
08x09,Unknown,"Me, too. Totally."
08x09,Unknown,Supafine.
08x09,Unknown,(giggles)
08x09,Unknown,Robin
08x09,Unknown,"Hey there, Scherbats, your voice of reason here."
08x09,Unknown,What you doing?
08x09,Unknown,"I hope you don't mind, but I was hungry, so I ordered MacLaren's new special."
08x09,Unknown,I couldn't eat lunch at work because they ordered
08x09,(voice breaking),Thai food.
08x09,Unknown,"I miss you, Cornelius!"
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
08x09,Unknown,You're so sensitive.
08x09,Unknown,And deep.
08x09,Unknown,No. You're better than this.
08x09,Unknown,Barney is not like lobster.
08x09,Unknown,"Okay, that's unfortunate, but it doesn't mean you have to hook up with Barney."
08x09,Unknown,Whoa!
08x09,Unknown,"God, you said that out loud!"
08x09,Unknown,"No, I didn't."
08x09,Unknown,How would you know? You're out of control.
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, you think you're so smart, don't you, b*tch?"
08x09,Unknown,"Um, billion-dollar idea alert."
08x09,Unknown,Why should bibs only be socially acceptable when you're eating lobster?
08x09,Unknown,"If we could wear them all the time,"
08x09,(voice breaking),then Corny would still be with us right now.
08x09,Unknown,I miss...
08x09,Picture a bib that looks like your suit,"a collar, a tie, a jacket."
08x09,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
08x09,Unknown,Atta girl. Keep it cool.
08x09,Unknown,I could call them Brobibs!
08x09,Unknown,That's interesting.
08x09,Unknown,"Yeah, you got this."
08x09,Unknown,I'm sorry I called you a b*tch.
08x09,Unknown,What do you think?
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, that idea's amazeballs!"
08x09,Unknown,(giggles)
08x09,Unknown,That's it. I'm out of here.
08x09,Unknown,(footsteps)
08x09,Unknown,(door slams)
08x09,Unknown,I'm out of control.
08x09,Unknown,I came this close to telling Barney that I wanted him.
08x09,Unknown,"Robin, as your friend, I got to be honest."
08x09,Unknown,I think this Brobibs thing is a frickin' gold mine.
08x09,Unknown,What? No.
08x09,Unknown,"Lily, I really need advice."
08x09,Unknown,Okay.
08x09,Unknown,Invest now.
08x09,Unknown,"Seriously, it's like Apple at ten dollars a share."
08x09,Unknown,"Lily, please."
08x09,Unknown,"Okay, I'm sorry."
08x09,Unknown,"I'm just, I'm a little distracted."
08x09,Unknown,I-I got to get upstairs and check on Ted and Marvin.
08x09,Unknown,Can we please just talk about this Brobib thing another time?
08x09,Unknown,How was your day?
08x09,Unknown,"Good, although I think I just saw a woman with a full beard outside."
08x09,Unknown,Marvin crawled!
08x09,Unknown,What?
08x09,Unknown,He's never done that before.
08x09,Unknown,I know!
08x09,Unknown,I think I just saw a guy with breasts outside.
08x09,Unknown,Marvin crawled.
08x09,Unknown,I can't believe it. Believe it.
08x09,Unknown,I took a video for you.
08x09,Unknown,(sighs)
08x09,Unknown,Ted
08x09,,"You're doing it, Marvin."
08x09,Unknown,"Go, go, go, go, go."
08x09,Unknown,Oh!
08x09,Unknown,Your Uncle Ted is so proud.
08x09,Unknown,Whoops.
08x09,Unknown,Guess I had the camera flipped.
08x09,Unknown,I use it to check my teeth for debris.
08x09,Unknown,(Marvin laughing)
08x09,Unknown,"Ooh, sounds like somebody's ""crawling"" me."
08x09,Unknown,(whimpering)
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, sweetie, oh, come on."
08x09,Unknown,"Lil, listen, so we missed the first time he crawled."
08x09,Unknown,So what?
08x09,Unknown,"We'll see it the next time, I promise."
08x09,Unknown,Ted
08x09,,"Oh, my God, he just did it again!"
08x09,Unknown,(sobbing)
08x09,(sobbing) TED,"Guys, get in here! Marvin can't stop crawling!"
08x09,Unknown,He's Holden Crawl-field!
08x09,Unknown,Get in here right now--
08x09,Unknown,"nope, nope, it's over."
08x09,Unknown,(whimpering)
08x09,Unknown,"Okay, hey, I know."
08x09,Unknown,"Baby, I know, I know."
08x09,Unknown,"But, listen, there will be plenty of other Marvin firsts."
08x09,Unknown,"His first day at school, his first trip to meet Santa, his first touchdown pass for the 2032 Super Bowl champion Vikings-- no pressure."
08x09,Unknown,I'll love him even if he runs the ball into the end zone.
08x09,Unknown,So can we please just let this crawling thing go?
08x09,Unknown,"Yeah, okay. You're right."
08x09,Unknown,"I mean, I'm being nuts."
08x09,Unknown,We'll see it when we see it.
08x09,Unknown,Yeah.
08x09,Unknown,Do it.
08x09,Unknown,"If you ever want to see these boobs again, crawl, you son of a me."
08x09,Unknown,"Come on, Lil."
08x09,You know what they say,a watched tot never crawls.
08x09,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x09,Unknown,"Or calls you later in life, after it sees this disturbing footage."
08x09,Unknown,"Hey, Lily, Marshall."
08x09,Unknown,"Uh, Lily, we need to talk."
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, that sounds serious!"
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, you guys should talk about it down at the bar until after Marvin's asleep."
08x09,Unknown,"And if you want to stay down there until after SportsCenter's over, that's fine, too."
08x09,Unknown,Ooh.
08x09,Unknown,Keep sh**ting.
08x09,Unknown,"If you miss it, I'm leaving you."
08x09,Unknown,(Marvin giggles)
08x09,Unknown,"Yeah, that seems about right."
08x09,Unknown,Sorry if I'm bad company.
08x09,Unknown,I'm not sure anything is gonna take my mind off of missing Marvin's first crawl.
08x09,Unknown,"Lily, I've had a revelation."
08x09,Unknown,Brobibs for women.
08x09,Unknown,Bitchbibs!
08x09,Unknown,"You know Barney's gonna sue us, but damn it, let's just go for it."
08x09,Unknown,"No, Lily, this is serious."
08x09,Unknown,"When that doctor told me I couldn't eat lobster and I did it anyway, it almost k*lled me."
08x09,But here's the thing,I never wanted lobster again.
08x09,Unknown,So the solution is obvious.
08x09,Unknown,"The only way to get Barney out of my system is to get him into my system, one last time."
08x09,Unknown,"It's brilliant, right?"
08x09,Unknown,Not brilliant at all.
08x09,Unknown,Thanks for being on board. Not on board.
08x09,Unknown,It means a lot. Big mistake.
08x09,Unknown,You're my girl.
08x09,Unknown,Now it's just a question of how to get him...
08x09,(panting),"Hey, Robin, I just got your text."
08x09,Unknown,What's the big emergency?
08x09,Unknown,"Hi, Barney!"
08x09,Unknown,You seem like you run fast.
08x09,Unknown,Do you want me to fan you with my
08x09,Unknown,US
08x09,Unknown,magazine?
08x09,Unknown,"He's fine. Thanks, Patrice."
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, thank goodness you're here."
08x09,Unknown,"I just got this new printer, and I need somebody big and strong to take it to my office for me."
08x09,Unknown,I promise to repay you.
08x09,Unknown,"We'll do it for you, Robin!"
08x09,Unknown,"Don't you have a late-breaking weather story to cover, Brandi?"
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, I did it already."
08x09,Unknown,It rained.
08x09,Unknown,(cell phone ringing)
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, I got to jump on a big Brobibs conference call."
08x09,Unknown,The lawyer from Dude Aprons is really busting my balls.
08x09,Unknown,See ya.
08x09,Unknown,(Robin sighs)
08x09,Unknown,"Nobody asked for your help, Patrice!"
08x09,Unknown,"You either, Brandi!"
08x09,(giggles),Stop it.
08x09,Unknown,"Hey, hey."
08x09,Unknown,What are you guys doing slobbering all over my friend?
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, Barney, don't be jealous."
08x09,Unknown,"If you're gonna drool, do it in style!"
08x09,Unknown,Just go to Brobibs.com.
08x09,Unknown,We've got every look in the book.
08x09,Unknown,The Business Casual.
08x09,Unknown,The Preppy.
08x09,Unknown,The Robin Williams.
08x09,Unknown,(laughs)
08x09,Unknown,Bib up!
08x09,Unknown,"Brobibs is in no way affiliated with, inspired by or derivative of Dude Aprons."
08x09,Unknown,(video game weapons zapping)
08x09,Unknown,"Hey, there."
08x09,Unknown,Hey!
08x09,Unknown,It is so good to see you.
08x09,Unknown,(weapons zapping)
08x09,Unknown,Barney
08x09,,"Thanks, Robin."
08x09,Unknown,This game affects my league score. (yells)
08x09,Unknown,"Look, I don't agree with your lobster quest, but I can't stand watching you make a fool of yourself."
08x09,Unknown,You want the fix? I got the fix.
08x09,Unknown,Back in college...
08x09,Unknown,"it was love at first sight for me and Marshall, but when it came to making the first move, well, he needed help."
08x09,Unknown,So I took matters into my own hands.
08x09,Unknown,♪
08x09,Unknown,Let's get out of here.
08x09,Unknown,"You just need a girl who, I don't know, gets a few drinks in her and wants to have fun and put on a show. Mm-hmm."
08x09,Unknown,"And it drives guys crazy, 'cause you both don't even care."
08x09,Unknown,It's just stupid and fun.
08x09,Unknown,(sighs)
08x09,Unknown,"Lily, that sounds perfect. Thank you."
08x09,Unknown,Mm. Just stupid.
08x09,Unknown,Stupid and fun.
08x09,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x09,Unknown,Who the hell is that?
08x09,Unknown,"Hey, guys."
08x09,Unknown,"Barney, this is Brandi, my fun friend from work, who just doesn't even care."
08x09,Unknown,"Hello, Brandi."
08x09,Unknown,Congratulations on the gig.
08x09,Unknown,"Aw, thank you!"
08x09,Unknown,World Wide News is an amazing place to work.
08x09,Unknown,"Not that gig, sweetheart."
08x09,Unknown,(raspy sigh)
08x09,Unknown,(heavy breathing)
08x09,Unknown,Lily
08x09,,Marshall!
08x09,Unknown,What? Ow.
08x09,Unknown,It's late.
08x09,Unknown,I'm so tipsy.
08x09,Unknown,(laughs)
08x09,Unknown,It is late. We should get out of here.
08x09,Unknown,"So, Brandi, ever sneak into the studio and do it in front of the weather map?"
08x09,Unknown,No. Why do you ask?
08x09,Unknown,No reason.
08x09,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x09,Unknown,Someone is about to get unseasonably banged.
08x09,Unknown,Damn it!
08x09,Unknown,What did I do wrong?
08x09,Unknown,"Nothing. It was awesome. Oh, Marshall, let's go!"
08x09,Unknown,"Hey. Hey, Lilypad!"
08x09,Unknown,"So, don't be upset."
08x09,Unknown,Ted... took Marvin shopping and sort of bought him... all his winter clothes.
08x09,Unknown,(Lily squeals)
08x09,TED (over baby monitor),Get ready for our star runway model--
08x09,Unknown,"or should I say, our star"
08x09,Unknown,crawlway
08x09,Unknown,model.
08x09,Unknown,"He's doing it again, guys! Get in here!"
08x09,Unknown,"N-No-no, it's over."
08x09,Unknown,That's it. Ted's fired.
08x09,Unknown,"Fired? No, c-come on, Lily, he's helping us out."
08x09,Unknown,"Plus, next week, your dad'll be back, and Ted has the meeting with that headhunter."
08x09,Unknown,Let's just stay cool.
08x09,Unknown,Ted
08x09,,"Starting at quarterback, the pride of Cleveland..."
08x09,Unknown,(gasps) Marvin Eriksen! Right?
08x09,Unknown,"Right, guys? He's gonna be a little Browns fan."
08x09,Unknown,(wails)
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, by the way, I cancelled that meeting with the headhunter, so I can take care of Marvin next week."
08x09,Unknown,"What? No, no, my dad'll be better by then."
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, I gave Mickey the month off."
08x09,Unknown,"It's supposed to snow, and, uh, Uncle Ted doesn't want to miss Marvin's first sleigh ride."
08x09,Unknown,You're fired. You're fired.
08x09,Unknown,Marvin has a bib with little... little dinosaurs on it.
08x09,Unknown,Maybe you should make one like that.
08x09,Unknown,"Brobibs are for grown men wearing bibs, Ted."
08x09,Unknown,I don't want them looking like idiots.
08x09,Unknown,(phone rings)
08x09,Unknown,"Lily, Marshall, you know you can't keep him away from me."
08x09,Unknown,He's gonna start asking questions.
08x09,Unknown,"Calm down, Ted."
08x09,Unknown,We-we just wanted to apologize.
08x09,Unknown,We overreacted before.
08x09,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
08x09,Unknown,Lily
08x09,,Meet us at the swim class you apparently signed Marvin up for.
08x09,Unknown,Bubble Buddies? I'd love t...
08x09,Unknown,"I mean, I'll have to check my skedge."
08x09,Unknown,"Sorry. When I'm excited, I abbreviate words I shouldn't."
08x09,Unknown,Lily
08x09,,"Come on, Ted, what do you say?"
08x09,Unknown,Fab. Perf.
08x09,Unknown,Sorry.
08x09,Unknown,See you at B-Buds.
08x09,Unknown,Bubble Buddies. Sorry.
08x09,Unknown,Augie. Jayden.
08x09,Unknown,Dylan. Girl Dylan.
08x09,Unknown,Lily
08x09,,"Hey, Ted. Hey. Where's Marvin?"
08x09,Unknown,Does Coach Amber have him warming up in the Jacooz?
08x09,Unknown,Sorry again.
08x09,Unknown,"Aw, hey, buddy, listen, we wanted to talk to you about how you've kind of been overdoing it with Marvin."
08x09,Unknown,I haven't been overdoing it.
08x09,Unknown,"Ted, we're in a baby swim class, and clearly you've done something extreme to get the naming rights to that lollipop bin."
08x09,Unknown,Marshall
08x09,,But I-I think that we've figured out what's going on with you.
08x09,Unknown,"See, after we let you go..."
08x09,Unknown,What is
08x09,Unknown,this?
08x09,Unknown,Marvin's
08x09,Unknown,Book of Firsts?
08x09,Unknown,(Lily gasps loudly)
08x09,Unknown,Ted took Marvin to see Santa?!
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, I am gonna take this book and I'm gonna shove it so far up his..."
08x09,Unknown,"The point is, it made us remember another scrapbook you made."
08x09,Unknown,"That project really was your baby, and now it's over, and you're scared to move on."
08x09,Unknown,"I poured my blood, sweat and tears into that building."
08x09,Unknown,"Though, to be fair, a lot of that happened the day I accidentally fell down the elevator shaft."
08x09,Unknown,Mm.
08x09,Unknown,"The point is, it's just really hard to let go."
08x09,Unknown,Especially when that building's my biggest accomplishment.
08x09,Unknown,"I mean, maybe if I was where you guys are at in life, with all you have to be proud of..."
08x09,Unknown,"We get it, okay?"
08x09,Unknown,You're always gonna be Uncle Ted.
08x09,Unknown,"But if Marvin can't be your next project, you need one of your own, and so we rescheduled your meeting with that headhunter."
08x09,Unknown,He's over there.
08x09,Unknown,Which one is he?
08x09,Unknown,"Thanks, guys."
08x09,Unknown,Marvin and I are lucky you're our parents.
08x09,Unknown,Aw.
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, hey, Ted?"
08x09,Unknown,"It's kind of a big, professional meeting--"
08x09,Unknown,you might want to trade out that lollipop for a shirt.
08x09,(chuckles),Yeah.
08x09,Unknown,"I'll just give it to one of these kids. Oh, buddy."
08x09,Unknown,"What? You're half naked, you're not a parent to any of these children--"
08x09,Unknown,don't offer 'em candy.
08x09,Unknown,I can't believe Barney went home with Brandi.
08x09,Unknown,I should have asked
08x09,Unknown,you
08x09,Unknown,to do that play with me.
08x09,Unknown,"Well, it's too late now, isn't it?"
08x09,Unknown,There he is. Straddle me. Start grinding.
08x09,Unknown,Nothing's off-limits.
08x09,Unknown,"So, last night Brandi and I got to the WWN studios, and my high-pressure system was ready to slam into her warm front."
08x09,Unknown,"The studio's unlocked, the weather map's up--"
08x09,Unknown,ready to do it in 17
08x09,Unknown,different states at once?
08x09,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x09,Unknown,"Um, actually..."
08x09,Unknown,I don't think I want that.
08x09,Unknown,I'm sorry.
08x09,Unknown,I'm-I'm...
08x09,Unknown,I'm gonna go.
08x09,Unknown,"Wait, you didn't sleep with her?"
08x09,Unknown,Nope.
08x09,Unknown,I spent the night thinking about how everything I've done since Quinn and I broke up has been a cry for help.
08x09,Unknown,"Dressing a dog up like me, hooking up with all those nannies..."
08x09,Unknown,"Brobibs? No, those are solid."
08x09,Unknown,I still want in.
08x09,Unknown,"And I realized that... I'm searching, searching for what I really want in life, and you know what?"
08x09,Unknown,I have absolutely no idea what that is.
08x09,Unknown,Wow.
08x09,Unknown,Barney... But...
08x09,Unknown,I'm going to figure it out.
08x09,Unknown,I have to.
08x09,Unknown,"Good night, guys."
08x09,Unknown,"God, I feel awful."
08x09,Unknown,"Barney is going through something big, and I've been obsessing about one stupid final hookup to get him out of my system."
08x09,Unknown,(sighs)
08x09,Unknown,He needs space... and time to figure things out.
08x09,Unknown,And I have to give it to him.
08x09,Unknown,(knocking on door)
08x09,Unknown,Robin? What are you doing here? It's okay if you don't know what you want in life...
08x09,Unknown,...as long as you know what you want... tonight.
08x09,Unknown,Well...
08x09,Unknown,I do know what I want.
08x09,Unknown,"Hi, Robin!"
08x09,Unknown,"Nobody asked you here, Patrice!"
08x09,Unknown,"Actually, I did."
08x09,Unknown,Last night.
08x09,Unknown,Let me go see if the studio's open.
08x09,Unknown,(chuckles softly)
08x09,Unknown,All right.
08x09,Unknown,"Oh, hi, Barney."
08x09,Unknown,I'm working late.
08x09,Unknown,(laughs)
08x09,Unknown,What are you doing here?
08x09,Unknown,I'm... (sighs)
08x09,Unknown,I don't know what I'm doing... here.
08x09,Unknown,"Barney... I don't know you that well, but... are you okay?"
08x09,Unknown,Yeah. What do you mean?
08x09,Unknown,"Well, whenever I see someone unhappy, I get the urge to give them cookies, and I really want to give you cookies right now."
08x09,Unknown,Cookie?
08x09,Unknown,"Lame. No, thanks."
08x09,Unknown,You sure? They're heart-shaped.
08x09,Unknown,"Sorry, a couple of them are broken."
08x09,(sobbing),I know how they feel. I'd love one.
08x09,Unknown,"After that, I sent Brandi packing, and Patrice and I talked all night."
08x09,Unknown,We're... kind of on a date right now.
08x09,Unknown,But if you'd like to throw on some clothes and join us for Crazy Eights...
08x09,Unknown,I can deal you in!
08x09,Unknown,My deck has puppies on it!
08x09,Unknown,Arf-arf!
08x09,Unknown,Um...
08x09,Unknown,I... got to go.
08x09,Unknown,"Look, I still feel bad I went too far with all the Marvin firsts--"
08x09,Unknown,"the Santa thing, especially."
08x09,Unknown,"I mean, I should've known."
08x09,Unknown,Are you sure you guys forgive me?
08x09,Unknown,"Absolutely. Don't worry, no grudges."
08x09,Unknown,Great. Next round's on me.
08x09,Unknown,"Coming, honey!"
08x09,Unknown,"Okay, you guys have all the numbers-- my cell, the restaurant, Center for Disease Control?"
08x09,Unknown,She's with her Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall.
08x09,Unknown,Nothing's gonna happen.
08x09,Unknown,You're right.
08x09,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x09,Unknown,You're totally right.
08x09,Unknown,Okay...
08x09,Unknown,"Bye, sweetie."
08x09,Unknown,"Here, you..."
08x09,Unknown,Mm...
08x09,Unknown,"Get out of here, ya crazy. Would you get out of here already."
08x09,Unknown,(Lily giggles)
08x09,Unknown,Who's ready to meet Santa?
08x10,Unknown,"Lily, I just saw the worst thing ever!"
08x10,(whispering),"Kind of busy right now, Marshall."
08x10,Unknown,Quiet. He can hear you.
08x10,Unknown,Marshall
08x10,,"Who's ""he""?!"
08x10,Unknown,He's coming! Everyone shut up!
08x10,Unknown,Narrator
08x10,Unknown,"Okay, kids, you're probably wondering how we all got here."
08x10,Unknown,"Oh, hey, buddy, can we borrow your air mattress?"
08x10,Unknown,My mom's coming into town for a few days.
08x10,Unknown,Absolutely not.
08x10,Unknown,"Bummer, I guess she can't stay with us."
08x10,Unknown,"Hey, look, what I just found."
08x10,Unknown,A list of hotels and other creative housing options.
08x10,Unknown,"Baby, my mom is not staying at a hotel."
08x10,Unknown,Or our storage unit.
08x10,Unknown,Why can't we borrow your air mattress?
08x10,Unknown,"Because when you animals borrow things, you never return them."
08x10,Unknown,That's ridiculous.
08x10,Unknown,"No, my Cleveland, Ohio, Chamber of Commerce mini-cooler is ridiculous."
08x10,Unknown,Ridiculous at keeping stuff cold while also promoting Ohio's second-largest rubber producer.
08x10,Unknown,"Watch your back, Akron."
08x10,Unknown,I totally gave that back.
08x10,Unknown,"And what about that ""Vote For Ted"" hoodie from when I ran for treasurer in high school?"
08x10,Unknown,"Mrs. Gooding said my concession speech was, ""full of grace."""
08x10,Unknown,I don't recall borrowing that.
08x10,Unknown,And whatever happened to my limited edition DVD of the classic 1989
08x10,Unknown,"Silverman-McCarthy romp,"
08x10,Unknown,"Weekend at Bernie's,"
08x10,Unknown,"""borrowed"" well over six months ago?"
08x10,Unknown,"Yeah, I'm keeping that."
08x10,Unknown,Those extra features are awesome.
08x10,"I mean, that making-of documentary? ""How Bernie Avoided The Gurney","A Cinematic Journey."""
08x10,Unknown,"Look, I'm just tired of people borrowing things and never returning them."
08x10,Unknown,"If you don't believe me, ask my ex-friend Stuart."
08x10,Unknown,"Ted, I gave your red cowboy boots back the day after Halloween."
08x10,Unknown,"How could you lie to me right to my face, Stuart?"
08x10,Unknown,You are a horrible human being.
08x10,Unknown,Congrats on your daughter's christening.
08x10,Unknown,"And where's the worst abuser of my generosity, Barney?"
08x10,Unknown,"Or should I say, ""Borrow-ney""?"
08x10,Unknown,You should never say that.
08x10,Unknown,And I think he's out with Patrice.
08x10,Unknown,"Uch, Patrice? That's still happening?"
08x10,Unknown,Narrator
08x10,Unknown,"Kids, you remember Patrice."
08x10,Unknown,She worked with your Aunt Robin.
08x10,Unknown,"Robin! You left your purse at the vending machine, and some guy tried to steal it!"
08x10,Unknown,"I fought him off, but I think I dislocated my shoulder."
08x10,Unknown,You scratched the leather! Oh!
08x10,Unknown,"Can't you do anything right, Patrice?!"
08x10,Unknown,That Barney-and-Patrice thing is so bogus.
08x10,Unknown,He's clearly trying to get back at me for rejecting him.
08x10,Unknown,"Um, Robin, after you rejected Barney, didn't he reject you?"
08x10,Unknown,And didn't you go over to his place and try to sleep with him in your purple-and-
08x10,Unknown,black underwear?
08x10,Unknown,"Hey, uh, Lil, feel free to disregard that ""Don't tell anyone about this ever"" thing."
08x10,Unknown,She has your mini-cooler.
08x10,Unknown,I knew it!
08x10,Unknown,"But seriously, what other reason would Barney have to date Patrice?"
08x10,Unknown,It's an over-correction.
08x10,Unknown,How dare you?! What is that?!
08x10,Unknown,"Barney was engaged to Quinn, a stripper he never really trusted."
08x10,So he overcorrects by dating her opposite,warm and nurturing Patrice.
08x10,Unknown,Lily
08x10,,"That does happen, like Ted."
08x10,Unknown,After you broke up with sweet innocent Victoria.
08x10,Unknown,"No, you hang up first."
08x10,Unknown,"No, you hang up first."
08x10,Unknown,"No, you hang up first."
08x10,Unknown,"Hang up, you little b*tch!"
08x10,Unknown,Over-correction.
08x10,Unknown,Yeah. And it's not just relationships.
08x10,Unknown,"Remember when that comedy club owner told Marshall that his ""funny fish names"" stand-up act didn't have enough edge?"
08x10,Unknown,Flounder? I barely know her! Oh!
08x10,Unknown,Over-correction.
08x10,Unknown,Although it was better than his Chris Rock rip-off.
08x10,Unknown,A trout with a daughter has one job.
08x10,Unknown,One job!

08x10,Unknown,I'm a little worried about Ted.
08x10,Unknown,"I mean, we're parents now, and even Barney is moving on."
08x10,Unknown,I just wish he had someone to talk to.
08x10,Unknown,Even for a week.
08x10,Unknown,"Or you know, four days, three nights."
08x10,Unknown,My mom is not staying with Ted!
08x10,Unknown,He'd love her bacon-

08x10,Unknown,"I'm her special boy, I get her special pancakes."
08x10,Unknown,But my dad is here nannying all the time.
08x10,Unknown,Then add your mom in?
08x10,Unknown,This place is crowded enough already.

08x10,Unknown,I cleaned it for you.
08x10,Unknown,"It's fine, Dad. Yeah, I had to check the suction, so I tested it on myself."
08x10,Unknown,"Oh, no."
08x10,Unknown,"Don't worry, the suction's fine, actually kind of nice."
08x10,Unknown,"Okay, Barney is so not for real about Patrice."
08x10,Unknown,"Today he did the craziest, most clearly staged for my benefit thing ever."
08x10,Unknown,"Hey, Patrice, you ready for lunch?"
08x10,Unknown,Sure.
08x10,Unknown,(scoffs)
08x10,Unknown,"Right, right?"
08x10,Unknown,"I mean, what's next, birthday gifts?"
08x10,Unknown,"Wake up, people, this is not an overcorrection, it's fraud, and we need to keep trying to stop this."
08x10,Unknown,"What do you mean, ""keep trying""?"
08x10,Unknown,Barney is not who you think he is.
08x10,Unknown,What do you mean?
08x10,Unknown,"Well, he has a book of plays he uses to trick women into sleeping with him."
08x10,Unknown,"Oh, no way, Barney's my honey bear."
08x10,Unknown,"Actually, one of his plays is called The Honey Bear."
08x10,Unknown,"He dresses up like Winnie the Pooh, and the next thing you know, his hand's stuck in your pot."
08x10,Unknown,"Robin, you're a doll for worrying about me, but that doesn't sound at all like my Barney."
08x10,Unknown,"Why won't you let me help you, Patrice?!"
08x10,Unknown,"She can't see that Barney is using her, and it breaks my heart."
08x10,Unknown,"You know, I-I-I love Patrice."
08x10,Unknown,We're like sisters.
08x10,Unknown,You've never gotten through even one exchange without screaming at her.
08x10,Unknown,"Sisters fight, Ted!"
08x10,Unknown,But the bond is always there.
08x10,Unknown,Okay? Okay.
08x10,Unknown,"And that's why I need to steal The Playbook and show it to Patrice, so she'll believe me."
08x10,Unknown,Or you could do almost anything else and not sound so creepy.
08x10,Unknown,Ted
08x10,,"Robin, seriously, this obsession isn't healthy."
08x10,Unknown,Just let it go.
08x10,Unknown,(sighs)
08x10,Unknown,Maybe you guys are right.

08x10,Unknown,Thanks for talking some sense into me.

08x10,Unknown,"Lily, can I ask you a question?"
08x10,Unknown,"If it's ""Did somebody put gravel in the couch cushions you're sleeping on,"" absolutely not."
08x10,Unknown,What would be the motive?
08x10,Unknown,"No, it's not that."
08x10,Unknown,"Uh, don't tell Marshall because he's not ready, but I think I might want to get back out there and meet a nice man."
08x10,Unknown,"Wow, that's great, Judy."
08x10,Unknown,And I thought you might be able to help because you always look so good.
08x10,Unknown,You think I look good?
08x10,Unknown,"I mean, you dress like a Duluth streetwalker, but my son seems to like it."
08x10,Unknown,I'll take it.
08x10,Unknown,"So, any advice?"
08x10,Unknown,"Well, first I'd throw out any giant sweater with a horse on it."
08x10,Unknown,"Even the ones...? Even the ones that have manes with real horse hair, yes."
08x10,Unknown,"And second, I'd let the gals out to play a little more."
08x10,Unknown,The gals?

08x10,Unknown,Hugh Hefner in your lobby right now.
08x10,Unknown,"I'm gonna grab my robe. ""Teddy's first Christmas""?"
08x10,Unknown,"Barney, are these my ornaments?"
08x10,Unknown,"That could be anyone's baby handprint, Ted."

08x10,Unknown,Why would you do that... with Mickey?
08x10,Unknown,"I've been lonely, Marshall, and all the men in St. Cloud's idea of romance is taking me ice fishing."
08x10,Unknown,That was me and your father's thing.
08x10,Unknown,"Plus, call it an overcorrection, but it's kind of nice being with a sophisticated, big-city man."
08x10,Unknown,(belches)
08x10,Unknown,"You know, I don't know what the big deal is."
08x10,Unknown,You've been bumping uglies with my daughter for years.

08x10,Unknown,(groans)
08x10,Unknown,How could you think that was Hef?
08x10,Unknown,It was an honest mistake.
08x10,Unknown,"That guy was black, Ted."

08x10,Unknown,Wait!
08x10,Unknown,What if I told you I was looking at your red cowboy boots right now?
08x10,Unknown,Describe them.
08x10,Unknown,They're red and they're cowboy boots.
08x10,Unknown,That's them!
08x10,Unknown,Why are they at Barney's?
08x10,Unknown,"Hey, Barney."
08x10,Unknown,Just returning Ted's boots I borrowed for Halloween.
08x10,Unknown,You were a cowboy?
08x10,Unknown,"No, my wife was Wonder Woman."
08x10,Unknown,Can you believe Ted thinks a guy can get laid wearing these?
08x10,Unknown,Challenge accepted.
08x10,Unknown,"Do you know what that sound is, Ted?"
08x10,Unknown,That's a red boot about to be savagely cut up by my pocketknife!
08x10,Unknown,You mean my pocketknife.
08x10,Unknown,I lent it to you two years ago.
08x10,Unknown,(knocking)
08x10,Unknown,Hey.
08x10,Unknown,Sorry about the Hugh Hefner mix-up.
08x10,Unknown,"But seriously, Jon Bon Jovi is downstairs."
08x10,Unknown,"You sure it isn't my landlady, Mrs. Takahashi?"
08x10,Unknown,I'm serious.

08x10,Unknown,"Oh. Hey, Patrice."
08x10,Unknown,Did you have any trouble finding Rudolph?
08x10,Unknown,"No, it was right on Ted's fire escape like you said."
08x10,Unknown,Are you sure he's okay with us borrowing it?
08x10,Unknown,Positive.
08x10,Unknown,I got your purse.
08x10,(whispering),"Oh, Ted, you're the best!"
08x10,Unknown,But I'm trapped in Barney's living room closet.
08x10,Unknown,"Oh, Ted, you're the worst."
08x10,Unknown,"Okay, enough messing around."
08x10,Unknown,I'm calling in The Wolf.
08x10,Unknown,Lily? Lily.
08x10,Unknown,(phone ringing nearby)
08x10,Unknown,(ringing is louder)
08x10,Unknown,What are you doing here? What are you doing here?
08x10,Unknown,"(phone beeps) Hold on, Marshall's calling me on the other line."
08x10,Unknown,"Lily, I just saw the worst thing ever."
08x10,Unknown,"Kind of busy right now, Marshall."
08x10,Unknown,Quiet. He can hear you.
08x10,Unknown,"Who's ""he""?"
08x10,Unknown,He's coming! Everyone shut up!
08x10,Unknown,I'm just gonna grab this star to put on top of the tree.
08x10,Unknown,It's gonna be legend--
08x10,Unknown,wait for it-- merry!
08x10,Unknown,(sighs)
08x10,Unknown,"What are you doing here, Lily?"
08x10,Unknown,I've been using Barney's apartment to pump milk for Marvin.
08x10,Unknown,What?! Why?
08x10,Unknown,Lily
08x10,Unknown,"Our apartment is so crowded these days, I don't get a minute to myself!"
08x10,Unknown,"I have a key to Barney's apartment, he has a kick-ass couch, and he DVR's all the"
08x10,Unknown,Real Housewives
08x10,Unknown,"shows, including the reunion specials."
08x10,Unknown,(whirring)
08x10,Unknown,What are you doing here?
08x10,Unknown,I came to get The Playbook so I could show Patrice who Barney really is.
08x10,Unknown,Why can't you just let them be happy?
08x10,Unknown,"Because they're not really happy, Lily!"
08x10,Unknown,Barney
08x10,,"Patrice, can you grab my computer from the bedroom?"
08x10,Unknown,"I want to change my Facebook status to ""happy!"""
08x10,Unknown,You shouldn't have that.
08x10,Unknown,You're right.
08x10,Unknown,(sighs)
08x10,Unknown,What?
08x10,Unknown,Where is Ted?
08x10,Unknown,My label maker!
08x10,Unknown,No! I'm never coming out!
08x10,Unknown,"You know, Marshall, you've been in there for a while now."
08x10,Unknown,And I couldn't help but notice you chugged that Super Big Gulp.
08x10,Unknown,"It's not gonna work, Mickey."
08x10,Unknown,My bladder's as big as your betrayal!
08x10,Unknown,"I see. So it's not gonna bother you to think about leaky faucets or open hydrants, or rushing rivers, or..."
08x10,Unknown,"Oh, God, I got to pee. Oh!"
08x10,Unknown,What is this?
08x10,Unknown,Where did you find that?
08x10,Unknown,"I didn't want to believe that this existed, but is this... The Playbook?"
08x10,(whispering),Let's see him lie his way out of this one.
08x10,Unknown,"Yes, it is."
08x10,Unknown,These are all the tricks I used to get women to sleep with me.
08x10,Unknown,"What do you mean, tricks?"
08x10,Unknown,"Like... ""The Two-Can-Play-at-That Game."""
08x10,Unknown,Can I help you?
08x10,Unknown,"I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but... my wife is having an affair with your husband."
08x10,Unknown,I even found a list of every dirty way they've enjoyed each others' bodies.
08x10,Unknown,I wish there was some way we could get back at them.
08x10,Unknown,There is.
08x10,Unknown,We can k*ll them. (laughs)
08x10,Unknown,I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this...
08x10,Unknown,You're not who I thought you were.
08x10,Unknown,"Patrice, I..."
08x10,Unknown,I need some air.
08x10,Unknown,I...
08x10,Unknown,"Come on, Patrice, you..."
08x10,Unknown,You have got to be kidding me.
08x10,Unknown,Wait. Is that my mini-cooler?!
08x10,Unknown,"Not now, Ted. Let's go!"
08x10,Unknown,Shh! Shh!
08x10,Unknown,"Patrice, I have done some sleazy stuff to seduce women, but I want to be a better person."
08x10,Unknown,You make me want to be a better person.
08x10,Unknown,I can't be with a man who has a playbook.
08x10,Unknown,I understand.
08x10,Unknown,Whoa.
08x10,Unknown,Whoa!
08x10,Unknown,Whoa!
08x10,Unknown,Whoa!
08x10,Unknown,Is that my garbage can?!
08x10,Unknown,I knew you were a keeper.
08x10,Unknown,(laughs)
08x10,Unknown,Oh.
08x10,Unknown,"(rapid, rhythmic beeping, Barney sighs)"
08x10,Unknown,I should go explain this to the super.
08x10,Unknown,"Hey, come with. There's a small chance Jon Bon Jovi's down in the lobby. ""You Give Love a Bad Name"" is the first track on my ""Get Psyched"" mix!"
08x10,Unknown,"Mine, too!"
08x10,Unknown,(sighing)
08x10,Unknown,You still don't believe those two are for real?
08x10,Unknown,I'll take that.
08x10,Unknown,The Ted Mosby Store is officially closed.
08x10,Unknown,What spilled in here?
08x10,Unknown,Breast milk.
08x10,Unknown,"Seriously, I give and give, and all I ask back is a little bit of respect."
08x10,Unknown,(sighs)
08x10,Unknown,(laughs)
08x10,Unknown,"Okay, so tonight got weird."
08x10,Unknown,You have no idea.
08x10,Unknown,My mom's apparently ready to get back out there.
08x10,Unknown,"Marshall, she told me all about it, and I was happy to help."
08x10,Unknown,You helped?! Why?
08x10,Unknown,"I know it's hard to think of your mom as a woman with needs, but you have to let her get out there and rediscover her sexuality with someone special."
08x10,Unknown,"Oh, you don't know."
08x10,Unknown,"No, uh, Marshall, I"
08x10,Unknown,do
08x10,Unknown,know.
08x10,Unknown,You just think it's gross because it's your parent.
08x10,Unknown,But you know what?
08x10,Unknown,It's beautiful. Mm.
08x10,Unknown,My mom and your dad are humping.
08x10,Unknown,(retching)
08x10,Unknown,I think you should be happy for them.
08x10,Unknown,What? Why?
08x10,Unknown,What is good about this?
08x10,Unknown,"Well, first of all, respect to Mickey."
08x10,Unknown,Your mom's a piece.
08x10,Unknown,"She's no Ted's mom, but she's a piece."
08x10,Unknown,"And secondly, I mean, it's nice that they found each other."
08x10,Unknown,"Sometimes you fall for someone you'd never expect, but that doesn't make it wrong."
08x10,Unknown,Doesn't everyone deserve to be happy?
08x10,Unknown,I guess none of us thought of it that way.
08x10,Unknown,Next round's on me.
08x10,Unknown,(sighs)
08x10,Unknown,Wow.
08x10,Unknown,I know.
08x10,Unknown,Barney's lost it.
08x10,Unknown,He needs an intervention.
08x10,Unknown,Oh! Oh! Oh...
08x10,Unknown,"Robin, after everything we've seen, do you still think Barney's faking this?"
08x10,Unknown,"No, but we have to stop it."
08x10,Unknown,Barney is not Barney anymore.
08x10,Unknown,"Well, people change."
08x10,Unknown,But not this fast and this drastically.
08x10,Unknown,"This is a cry for help, okay?"
08x10,Unknown,"If I was out of control, I would want you guys to help me."
08x10,Unknown,"So, what do you say? Intervention?"
08x10,Unknown,Intervention.
08x10,Unknown,(sighs)
08x10,Unknown,"Oh, good. You're all here."
08x10,Unknown,"Um, when Barney shows up, it's important for him not to feel ganged up on, so, let's start with, um, ""We love you, and we're worried about you."""
08x10,Unknown,All
08x10,,"We love you, and we're worried about you."
08x10,Unknown,Oh. Great.
08x10,Unknown,"But you know, with less pity in your eyes."
08x10,Unknown,"Sweetie, sit down."
08x10,Unknown,"Uh, no. Only the person getting the intervention sits down."
08x10,Unknown,All
08x10,,Yeah.
08x10,Unknown,Oh.
08x10,Unknown,Please tell me this is about my drinking.
08x10,Unknown,Damn it.
08x10,Unknown,"So, we, um... we just wanted to say that we're sorry for the way that we acted when we found out about you two."
08x10,Unknown,"Your happiness is what is most important, so, if you two want to date, it's okay by us."
08x10,Unknown,Who said anything about dating?
08x10,Unknown,This is just about sex.
08x10,Unknown,We're family... with benefits.
08x11,Unknown,Can I get you guys anything to drink?
08x11,Unknown,Both
08x11,,"Scotch, neat."

08x11,Unknown,"Kids, you may be wondering why five adults in their 30s would take a jinx so seriously."
08x11,Unknown,It all started one day five years ago.
08x11,Unknown,"Ooh,"
08x11,Unknown,Van Helsing.
08x11,Unknown,"Ooh,"
08x11,Unknown,Van Helsing.
08x11,Unknown,Jinx. You're jinxed.
08x11,Unknown,"That means that you can't speak until someone who was present for the jinx says your name, or else you will have very bad luck."
08x11,Unknown,(scoffs)
08x11,Unknown,That's ridiculous.
08x11,Unknown,(both gasp)
08x11,Unknown,You broke the jinx.
08x11,Unknown,"Marshall, I'm a grown-ass man."
08x11,Unknown,I'm on my building's co-op board.
08x11,Unknown,"When I say a Pinot Noir tastes luxuriously earthy with a hint of rhubarb, I'm not faking it."
08x11,Unknown,I've had several of the same sexual partners as Henry Kissinger.
08x11,Unknown,I'm not about to stop talking just because I was jinxed.
08x11,Unknown,Narrator
08x11,Unknown,"Barney broke three limbs and two vertebrae, but he never broke another jinx."
08x11,Unknown,"In fact, he started taking jinxes way too seriously."
08x11,Unknown,"Barney, I'm on hold with Sports Talk AM to talk to my childhood hero from the Minnesota Twins."
08x11,Unknown,Who's your childhood hero?
08x11,Unknown,Frank Viola. Frank Viola--
08x11,Unknown,jinx!
08x11,(over phone),"Hello, this is Frank."
08x11,Unknown,Anyone there?
08x11,Unknown,Hello?
08x11,Unknown,"I can hear you breathing, you coward."

08x11,Unknown,"So, when someone finally jinxed Barney for the first time in years, we were pretty psyched."
08x11,Unknown,The reign of terror is over!
08x11,Unknown,"I've had this cigar in my pocket for two years, waiting for this moment."
08x11,Unknown,"Aw, that would've been good about two years ago."

08x11,Unknown,"I don't think so, pal."
08x11,Unknown,This is gonna be a long jinx.
08x11,Unknown,Like Yom Kippur services long.
08x11,Unknown,"The only difference is, Yom Kippur's a fast and this one's gonna be a slow."
08x11,Oh! ROBIN,"Now, Ted, I was wondering if you could expand upon what you were saying earlier about antiquated currency."
08x11,Unknown,"Ah, yes, yes."
08x11,Unknown,"Contrary to popular belief, the buffalo nickel was modeled on the Black Diamond bison rather than the more iconic Western Plains bison."

08x11,Unknown,And what is that?
08x11,Unknown,A pit guy is someone you've been obsessed with for so long...

08x11,Unknown,Just drop her.
08x11,Unknown,Drop her in a pit.
08x11,Unknown,Enough.
08x11,Unknown,"We all have people that we would throw in our pits, and I'm sure we all have people who would like to throw us in their pits."

08x11,Unknown,I feel like I never see you guys anymore.

08x11,Unknown,Even that party at your place--
08x11,you guys just raced off into the night at 7,30.
08x11,Unknown,That's weird.
08x11,Unknown,But this is great-- the three hackmigos back together again.
08x11,Unknown,"We played Hacky Sack together once freshman year, Daryl."
08x11,Unknown,Once.
08x11,Unknown,"November 14, 1996."
08x11,Unknown,That is the best memory ever.
08x11,Unknown,Sure.
08x11,Unknown,(grunts)
08x11,Unknown,The three hackmigos for life.
08x11,Unknown,"To this day, we are still getting e-mails and posts from Daryl."
08x11,Unknown,"He has commented on every photo of Baby Marvin we have ever posted, and then he comments on his own comments."

08x11,Unknown,"Yeah, I didn't get a word of that."
08x11,Unknown,"Sorry, buddy."
08x11,Unknown,"Ah, Scherbatsky, it's my favorite time of year."

08x11,Unknown,We get to fire some people.
08x11,Unknown,Get into the spirit.
08x11,Unknown,"Look, Sandy, you might enjoy firing people for petty personal differences."
08x11,Unknown,I'd hardly call giving me gonorrhea a petty personal difference.

08x11,Unknown,"Not happening, bro."
08x11,Unknown,Hand get tired?
08x11,Unknown,"Not happening, bro."
08x11,Unknown,I hold in my hand the RSVP from Professor Vinick.
08x11,Unknown,Uh-huh.
08x11,Unknown,"Ah, he's checked ""Will not attend,"" which is fine, because all I needed to know was that he knows."
08x11,Unknown,So now I will throw this in the trash and never look at it.
08x11,Unknown,"What's this? ""I believe you've sent this to the wrong person."
08x11,Unknown,"I have no idea who Ted Mosby is."""
08x11,Unknown,Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, you'll remember who I am, Professor Vinick."
08x11,Unknown,You'll never forget it.
08x11,Unknown,"Not happening, bro."
08x11,Unknown,"Ted, just because we're coming with you to Wesleyan does not mean that we condone your behavior."
08x11,Unknown,Just using it as an excuse to see the old campus... and maybe watch you have a complete mental breakdown.
08x11,Unknown,What are you even gonna do when you see Professor Vinick?
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do."
08x11,Unknown,"Sweet merciful Franks Gehry and Lloyd Wright, from what brilliant mind was this work of art sired?"
08x11,Unknown,Mosby.
08x11,Unknown,Ted Mosby.

08x11,Unknown,But that's-that's...
08x11,Unknown,Impossible?

08x11,Unknown,Dead wrong.
08x11,(distorted),No!

08x11,Unknown,I'm gonna grab one of those giant dining hall hot dogs.
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, I love those huge wieners."
08x11,Unknown,I'm not so sure you heard me.
08x11,Unknown,"I said, ""I love those huge wieners."""
08x11,Unknown,I love them.
08x11,Unknown,In my mouth.
08x11,Unknown,"So, let me ask you a few questions, Clarice... Patrice."
08x11,Unknown,How would you rate your performance in the last six months?
08x11,Unknown,"Well, I don't like to talk about myself, but all my coworkers deserve an A-double-plus, that's for suresies."
08x11,Unknown,"Ooh, fancy lotion."
08x11,Unknown,It puts the lotion in the basket.
08x11,Unknown,"It's just, this is really nice lotion."
08x11,Unknown,"And what a pretty basket, Robin."
08x11,Unknown,"I know, that's why I bought it, Patrice!"
08x11,Unknown,"Man, it's like nothing has changed. Mmm, I know."
08x11,Unknown,"The bun, the relish."
08x11,Unknown,That's a knee.
08x11,Unknown,"It's a beautifully drawn knee, so?"
08x11,Unknown,That's a barn.
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, knee barn, right."
08x11,Unknown,"That's a great idea, Lily."
08x11,Unknown,"On the way home, we should stop at the knee barn, pick us up some wholesale knees. Yeah."
08x11,Unknown,Man
08x11,,Marshall? Lily!
08x11,Unknown,You... you're here.
08x11,Unknown,"Hi, Daryl."
08x11,(quietly),"Hi, Daryl."
08x11,Unknown,Hi.
08x11,Unknown,"Wow, after all these years."
08x11,Unknown,You look just like you do in my paintings.
08x11,Unknown,"Come here, guys."
08x11,Unknown,(grunts)
08x11,Unknown,There are men and there are gods.
08x11,Unknown,Antoni Gaudí was both.
08x11,Unknown,Ted
08x11,Unknown,There are jerk faces and there are buttholes.
08x11,Unknown,Professor Vinick was both.
08x11,Unknown,"Good one, Ted."
08x11,Unknown,"Come on, Vinick, give me an opening."
08x11,Unknown,Gaudí's architecture gave expression to the anarchic geometric form of nature.
08x11,Unknown,"""Gaudí's architecture..."""
08x11,Unknown,"Actually, that's a really good point."

08x11,Unknown,"What are you doing here, Daryl?"
08x11,Unknown,"Well, I live right down the street."
08x11,Unknown,But I work right here.
08x11,Unknown,"Whoa. Oh, boy."
08x11,Unknown,Marshall
08x11,,Are those...
08x11,Unknown,"(clears throat) ...our, our faces up there, buddy?"
08x11,Unknown,"Hack, yeah!"
08x11,Unknown,It was just as much your idea as mine to open up a Hacky Sack store here at Wesleyan.
08x11,Unknown,So you never left?
08x11,Unknown,"Once. I met a girl on Craigslist, and I flew to Boston to meet her."
08x11,Unknown,"She was a man, 300 pounds, and robbed me."
08x11,Unknown,"Still, the best night of my life."
08x11,Unknown,Until now!
08x11,Unknown,The three hackmigos back together again!
08x11,Unknown,"You know, I've been waiting forever to give you something."
08x11,Unknown,"You're coming with me to my house, and I'm not taking no for an answer."
08x11,Unknown,Barney
08x11,Unknown,"Dude, this is your chance."
08x11,Unknown,"Set me free, and I will lie you out of this creepynightmare."
08x11,Unknown,Marshall
08x11,Unknown,This is a tough one.
08x11,Unknown,"On the one hand, we might die."
08x11,Unknown,"On the other, you're jinxed."
08x11,Unknown,Barney
08x11,Unknown,"Let me free, Marshall."
08x11,Unknown,This guy could be violent.
08x11,Unknown,Marshall
08x11,Unknown,Violent... Viola...

08x11,Unknown,"We would love to come to your house, Daryl!"
08x11,Unknown,Yeah!
08x11,Unknown,"Okay, um... how often are you and Barney doing it?"
08x11,Unknown,"That's a strange question, Robin."
08x11,Unknown,You're right.
08x11,Unknown,Maybe I should leave.
08x11,Unknown,"Yeah, maybe you should."
08x11,Unknown,You're fired.
08x11,Unknown,Wow. Just wow.
08x11,Unknown,Ted Mosby. I'm a former student of yours.
08x11,Unknown,"You know, I actually became an architect."
08x11,Unknown,Any chance you remember me?
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, please excuse me, I've been teaching for over 20 years."
08x11,Unknown,"All the faces start to blend together unless you have a, a weird mustache or, or something."
08x11,Unknown,"Junior year I tried to grow muttonchops, but people kept saying my face made them nauseous."
08x11,Unknown,"Well, not people. You."
08x11,Unknown,"Anyway, I would be honored if you, if you took a look at my building."
08x11,Unknown,This... is hideous.
08x11,Unknown,You'll never be an architect.
08x11,Unknown,You'll never be an architect.
08x11,Unknown,You'll never be an architect. You'll
08x11,Unknown,never
08x11,Unknown,be an architect!
08x11,Unknown,You'll never be an architect.
08x11,Unknown,Wait. I was mistaken.
08x11,Unknown,You most definitely will be an architect.
08x11,Unknown,Really?
08x11,Unknown,"These are astonishing, Handlebar Pete."
08x11,Unknown,"So, when you said ""surprise in your house,"" what you really meant was ""surprise in the poorly lit windowless basement of your house."""
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, you guys are gonna love what I have to show you."
08x11,Unknown,"I am so excited, I could just cry and laugh and scream and just punch the wall over and over and over and over and over!"
08x11,Unknown,"Could we just see it, like, up in the living room or anywhere less... gimp-storagey?"
08x11,Unknown,(laughs)
08x11,Unknown,I just realized I want to take a picture of this.
08x11,Unknown,I want to put your faces on my mantel like a trophy.
08x11,Unknown,Like a trophy!
08x11,Unknown,Aah...! Aah...!
08x11,(singsongy),Here I come.
08x11,Unknown,And I've got your surprise right here!
08x11,Unknown,"No! We don't want your surprise, Daryl!"
08x11,Unknown,"We're not your amigos, we're definitely not your hackmigos."
08x11,Unknown,"And before you m*rder us, you should know that we have a child!"
08x11,Unknown,He probably has eight or nine!
08x11,Unknown,What? m*rder?
08x11,Unknown,I wanted to give you a cheque.
08x11,Unknown,"For $100,000... for coming up with the idea of the Three Hackmigos with me."
08x11,Unknown,I brought you down here to show you all my inventory.
08x11,Unknown,Business has really exploded.
08x11,Unknown,(laughs)
08x11,Unknown,"I mean, I'm sort of the Mark Zuckerberg of jam-band concert parking lot athletics."
08x11,Unknown,"Well, second."
08x11,Unknown,"But I'm coming for you, Devil Stick Ron."
08x11,Unknown,(screaming)
08x11,Unknown,Why would you fire me?
08x11,Unknown,Because nobody should be as happy as you are.
08x11,Unknown,And also your cookies... they're only pretty good.
08x11,Unknown,(gasps)
08x11,Unknown,"Robin, is this really about me?"
08x11,(voice breaking),"No, it's not."
08x11,Unknown,"The old ""fire and bang."" Respect, Scherbatsky."
08x11,Unknown,"Pretty good, right? Right, Handlebar Pete?"
08x11,Unknown,"Ah, you got it easy with that sweet, sweet 'stache."
08x11,Unknown,"Hey, Ted, I see you're holding a little version of your building and yelling at strangers."
08x11,Unknown,So I assume it all worked out?
08x11,Unknown,"I realized, since I work in a three-dimensional medium, the only way to really stick it to Vinick would be with a three-dimensional model."
08x11,Unknown,"Whatever you do, don't march in there thinking, ""I'm gonna do the worm."
08x11,Unknown,"That'll show 'em!"""
08x11,Unknown,"Seriously, guys, I can't stress enough how bad my prom was."
08x11,Unknown,Speaking of the past...
08x11,Unknown,"Wow, we feel like idiots. We're sorry."
08x11,Unknown,"You know, honestly, it's fine."
08x11,Unknown,Look how great I'm doing.
08x11,Unknown,Look at what I've built. I don't need the validation of some people from college to feel good about myself.

08x11,Unknown,we do.

08x11,Unknown,"So, you completely rejected the guy who's been obsessing about you for 16 years, and he was okay with it?"
08x11,Unknown,Whoa.

08x11,Unknown,"Just seeing you with Barney has brought up some old feelings, and I..."
08x11,Unknown,I really don't like feelings.
08x11,Unknown,But that's not your fault or Barney's fault.

08x11,Unknown,♪ I know you'll hear me somehow... ♪
08x11,Unknown,So you fired Patrice?
08x11,Unknown,"No, she's staying."
08x11,Unknown,♪ The places we will go...
08x11,Unknown,"Let's get out of here, guys."
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, Mr. Mosby."
08x11,Unknown,You built a model of your building.
08x11,Unknown,No.
08x11,Unknown,Why? To prove some sort of point?
08x11,Unknown,This is just sad.
08x11,Unknown,"No, no, I was just throwing it out."
08x11,Unknown,"Sure, you were."
08x11,Unknown,No!
08x11,Unknown,"No, I-I-I had a transcendent moment where I found emotional clarity!"
08x11,Unknown,"And I realize shouting that makes it seem like it's not true, but I did!"
08x11,Unknown,"Yeah, we're gonna grab some snacks."
08x11,Unknown,You guys want anything?
08x11,Unknown,Spicy beef jerky.
08x11,Unknown,Got you loud and clear.
08x11,Unknown,(sighs)
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, my God! Barney!"
08x11,Unknown,You unjinxed me!
08x11,Unknown,"I'm free! If the bison on the nickel could hear you talk about them, they would diminish their population even further on purpose."
08x11,Unknown,"If Lily wants a big wiener in her mouth, she's got my number."
08x11,Unknown,And I'm sorry that you took the rap for all the farting on the car ride up here. That was me! (sighs)
08x11,Unknown,"The ring! What's, what's, what's the ring?"
08x11,Unknown,"Right, the ring. I'm gonna ask Patrice to marry me."
08x11,Unknown,Both
08x11,,Are you serious?
08x11,Unknown,Jinx! Good!
08x11,Unknown,I need to say some things without you interrupting.
08x11,Unknown,"Yes, I am serious. I know that if you could talk, you'd say that I'm crazy or that I'm overcorrecting or that I'm moving too fast."
08x11,Unknown,But you would be wrong.
08x11,Unknown,"Look, I have banged my way through every bimbo in the tristate area, and it left me feeling nothing but, but broken."
08x11,Unknown,"But now, with Patrice, for the first time in my life, I feel settled and happy."
08x11,Unknown,I want to feel this way forever.
08x11,Unknown,So tomorrow night on the roof of the World Wide News building--
08x11,Unknown,that's Patrice's favorite spot--
08x11,Unknown,I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
08x11,Unknown,"Ah, poot-tu-tat! You're jinxed."
08x11,I'll unjinx you if you'll follow these two rules,"one: you can't try to talk me out of it, and two: you can't tell anybody. Agreed?"
08x11,Unknown,"It's a jinx swear, so if you break it, I get to hit you in the nuts three times with a Wiffle ball bat."
08x11,Unknown,Thank you... Ted.
08x11,Unknown,Hey...
08x11,Unknown,"Hi, guys!"
08x11,Unknown,No. But you're jinxed!
08x11,Unknown,I tricked Ted into saying my name.
08x11,Unknown,All
08x11,,"Aw, come on, Ted!"
08x11,Unknown,Jinx! Jinx! Ha-ha!
08x11,Unknown,The reign of terror is back! (evil laugh)
08x11,Unknown,"Hey, if you guys don't want me to smoke or fart in here, just speak up."
08x11,Unknown,Nothing? Great.
08x11,Unknown,"Thanks for the spicy beef jerky, dude."
08x11,Unknown,"Anyway, I think we could all use a little quiet."
08x11,Unknown,"Unless you have something you want to talk about, Ted?"
08x11,Unknown,No.
08x11,Unknown,(engine starts)
08x11,Unknown,"Not happening, bro."
08x11,Unknown,Narrator
08x11,Unknown,So I had promised not to tell anyone about Barney's plan to propose to Patrice.
08x11,Unknown,But I knew deep down Robin deserved to know.
08x11,Unknown,"Uh, there he is! The youngest architect ever to build a skyscraper in New York City!"
08x11,Unknown,The shockingly still single Ted Mosby.
08x11,Unknown,"You hear that, ladies?"
08x11,Unknown,I can't believe the GNB Tower opens tonight.
08x11,Unknown,"Ted, your building finally gets unveiled to the whole world."
08x11,Unknown,(gasps)
08x11,Unknown,"You hear that, ladies?!"
08x11,Unknown,Nervous?
08x11,Unknown,Everything comes out of my body in liquid form now.
08x11,Unknown,"Ignore that, ladies."
08x11,Unknown,"Plus, I, I keep having this nightmare where King Kong shows up to the opening but refuses to climb my building because, in his words, ""It's a bit derivative."""
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, stop it, tonight is gonna be amazing."
08x11,Unknown,"And we are definitely gonna be there to toast you, but we might have to leave a little early if that's okay."
08x11,Unknown,My dad just gave us the most amazing Christmas gift ever.
08x11,Unknown,Our first night away since Marvin was born.
08x11,Unknown,24 hours straight without that little bastard.
08x11,Unknown,Robin
08x11,,Aw.
08x11,Unknown,This will be a nice memory to share with Marvin when he's older and deciding whether or not to put you in a home.
08x11,Unknown,"Hey, we need this."
08x11,Unknown,We're maximizing our time away by planning everything down to the minute.
08x11,Unknown,See?
08x11,2,12 p.m.-- guilt Ted into saying it's okay if we leave early tonight.
08x11,Unknown,It's okay if you leave early tonight.
08x11,Unknown,"Look, I just appreciate you showing up at all on your big night away."
08x11,Unknown,"I mean, Barney's not even gonna be there."
08x11,Unknown,What?
08x11,Unknown,This is the biggest night of your career.
08x11,Unknown,Why isn't Barney coming?
08x11,Unknown,I don't know--
08x11,Unknown,"he said, ""Legendary"" and ""Challenge accepted,"" and then he winked. ""Wait for it,"" you know, all that stuff."
08x11,Unknown,That does sound like him.
08x11,Unknown,"Well, we're your real friends and we wouldn't miss it for the world."
08x11,That is why we will see you tonight from 7,03 to 7:14.
08x11,Unknown,"Bye, guys. Good night. Bye."
08x11,Unknown,"Okay, what's the real reason Barney's not coming?"
08x11,Unknown,Narrator
08x11,Unknown,Here was my chance to tell Robin about Barney.
08x11,Unknown,"Yeah, actually, Barney didn't say what he was doing tonight."
08x11,Unknown,"Anyway, uh, you know, I'm not taking anyone to the opening, so you want to be my date?"
08x11,Unknown,Sure.
08x11,Unknown,"Okay, Dad, I-I made you a list of Marvin's nightly schedule down to the minute."
08x11,Unknown,Okay.
08x11,"Uh, ""9",06 p.m.--
08x11,Unknown,"put on edible underwear."""
08x11,Unknown,"Wrong list, wrong list."
08x11,Unknown,"Come on, relax."
08x11,Unknown,I know this little guy like the back of my hand.
08x11,Unknown,"Dear Lord, what is that?"
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, jam, okay."
08x11,Unknown,Just jam.
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, I-I forgot the lullaby."
08x11,Unknown,Do you know Marvin's lullaby?
08x11,Unknown,We sing it to him every night.
08x11,Unknown,"♪ Night, night, little Marvin ♪"

08x11,Unknown,Just kidding.
08x11,Unknown,We did it.
08x11,Unknown,"Yeah, we did."
08x11,Unknown,"Now that we're out the door, I actually don't feel anxious."
08x11,Unknown,(phone rings)
08x11,Unknown,"Whoa, oh, my God, it's your dad!"
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, something horrible happened-- aah!"
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, it's Ted, relax."
08x11,Unknown,"Bar, now."
08x11,Unknown,What is it?
08x11,Unknown,He needs me.
08x11,Unknown,"But, baby, what about our magical romantic night?"
08x11,Unknown,In four minutes we're supposed to be doing hand stuff in the cab.
08x11,Unknown,I'll be quick--
08x11,Unknown,I'm sure it's nothing huge.
08x11,Unknown,That's huge.
08x11,Unknown,"Yeah, that's why Barney's not coming tonight."
08x11,Unknown,He's getting engaged.
08x11,Unknown,And I knew that I had to tell Robin.
08x11,Unknown,But?
08x11,Unknown,"I may have, uh... asked her to be my date instead."
08x11,Unknown,What is wrong with me?
08x11,Unknown,"Deep down, is there still some crazy part of me that thinks I'm gonna wind up with Robin?"
08x11,Unknown,Am I that deluded?
08x11,Unknown,"If so, I need to grow up."
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, um, by the way, I'm breaking a jinx swear here, so don't tell Barney or he gets to whack me in the nuts three times with a Wiffle ball bat."
08x11,Unknown,"Sure, pretty standard."
08x11,Unknown,Robin deserves the chance to go after Barney one last time if that's what she wants.
08x11,Unknown,"Thanks, buddy."
08x11,Unknown,This helped.
08x11,Unknown,I'm gonna go tell her.
08x11,Unknown,One quick thing. Yeah.
08x11,Unknown,Don't.
08x11,Unknown,Wow.
08x11,Unknown,Nice.
08x11,Unknown,"You know, now that I'm here, I don't feel that anxious."
08x11,Unknown,(phone rings)
08x11,Unknown,It's my dad--
08x11,Unknown,something horrible's happened!
08x11,Unknown,"My husband, relax."
08x11,Unknown,"Hey, um, I'm gonna be a little while, baby."
08x11,Unknown,"It's a long story, but Ted needs my help."
08x11,Unknown,"Okay, but hurry or I'm gonna start doing number 11 on my own."
08x11,Unknown,You can do that by yourself?
08x11,Unknown,"Pilates, b*tch."
08x11,Unknown,"Okay, why shouldn't I tell Robin?"
08x11,Unknown,"Because deep down some crazy part of you still thinks you're gonna wind up with her, and I agree."
08x11,Unknown,"Marshall... I'm sorry, I'm Team Tedward."
08x11,Unknown,"Always have been, always will be."
08x11,Unknown,"Now, listen."
08x11,Unknown,I want my best friend to be happy.
08x11,Unknown,"And if Robin could mean happiness for you, then, dear God, why help her go after another man?"
08x11,Unknown,Because she might still be in love with him.
08x11,Unknown,"To not tell her, to not give her that chance, it's... it's selfish."
08x11,Unknown,So be selfish.
08x11,Unknown,I can't do that.
08x11,Unknown,"Tell that to the onion rings we just ""split."""
08x11,Unknown,(sighs)
08x11,Unknown,Robin is my friend.
08x11,Unknown,She's always been more than that and you know it.
08x11,Unknown,"Now, as we speak, my wife is in a hotel room cheating on me... with herself."
08x11,Unknown,But I'm not leaving here until you promise not to say a word about this to Robin.
08x11,Unknown,"Now repeat after me. ""I..."""
08x11,Unknown,"Well, I can do more at a time than ""I."" ""I, Ted Mosby, promise to stop ""putting everyone else's interests ahead of my own, and for once in my life, do what's best for me."""
08x11,Unknown,I...
08x11,Unknown,"Sorry, what was the rest of that?"
08x11,Unknown,"Hey, Dad, just taking a break from our amazing night to check in."
08x11,Unknown,"I bet Marvin's pretty devastated that I'm not there, huh?"
08x11,Unknown,Not at all-- I don't think he even noticed you're gone.
08x11,Unknown,It's kind of like Mommy who?
08x11,Unknown,(laughs)
08x11,Unknown,"Oh... oh, good."
08x11,Unknown,"But I should probably sing him his nighttime lullaby over the phone, just in case."
08x11,Unknown,Sang it already-- nailed it.
08x11,Unknown,Did you do the horsie?
08x11,Unknown,Yep. The birdie?
08x11,Unknown,Yep. Elephant?
08x11,Unknown,Yep. Moose.
08x11,Unknown,"No moose, trick question."
08x11,Unknown,Robot.
08x11,(robot voice),Affirmative.
08x11,Unknown,"Look, I should go."
08x11,Unknown,Marvin's asleep in my arms.
08x11,Unknown,"Mmm, his head smells like love."
08x11,Unknown,Bye.
08x11,Unknown,(sighs)
08x11,Unknown,Narrator
08x11,Unknown,"And so, kids, on that cold December night I decided to take your Uncle Marshall's advice and be a little selfish."
08x11,Unknown,Whoa.
08x11,Unknown,Hello... and hubba-hubba.
08x11,Unknown,"Aw, thanks."
08x11,Unknown,But tonight is about my main man Mosby.
08x11,Unknown,Really? Why?
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, Ted, tell Ranjit the huge thing that's happening tonight."
08x11,Unknown,Barney's getting engaged.
08x11,Unknown,Ranjit out.
08x11,Unknown,Bar-Barney's getting engaged?
08x11,Unknown,"He asked me to keep it a secret, but I thought you deserved to know... in case you wanted to do something about it."
08x11,Unknown,Do you?
08x11,Unknown,Ranjit
08x11,,"Do you, Robin?"
08x11,Unknown,"Ranjit, a little privacy, please?"
08x11,Unknown,"Sorry, not listening."
08x11,Unknown,"Nice, uneven floor there, Ted."
08x11,Unknown,(sighs)
08x11,Unknown,"Lily, are you drunk?"
08x11,Unknown,What? I... I'm on vacation.
08x11,Unknown,I may have cracked open the minibar to celebrate.
08x11,Unknown,Who invited the narc?
08x11,Unknown,"Hey, listen, I know that you miss Marvin, but it's not like we could've brought him to a black tie event anyway."
08x11,Unknown,I don't think that they make tuxedo onesies.
08x11,Unknown,"I mean, at least not ones that are in style."
08x11,Unknown,"I mean, a bow tie?"
08x11,Unknown,Is it 1998 already?
08x11,Unknown,"Yeah, these parents are so lame and-and clingy."
08x11,Unknown,"Yeah, it's like, cut the cord already, right, guys?"
08x11,Unknown,"Yeah, yeah, that baby's not even cute."
08x11,Unknown,Super ugly baby.
08x11,Unknown,It's almost physically repulsive.
08x11,Unknown,Aw.... Aw...
08x11,Unknown,"Great, I just started lactating."
08x11,Unknown,"Me, too."
08x11,Unknown,"So, what do you want to do?"
08x11,Unknown,"Robin, I do not want to meddle, but this is like the classic love song says..."
08x11,Unknown,(singing loudly and high-pitched)
08x11,Unknown,Ranjit.
08x11,Unknown,"Ranjit, let's just communicate via text from now on, okay?"
08x11,Unknown,(singing stops)
08x11,Unknown,I appreciate what you're doing.
08x11,Unknown,But I'm not chasing after Barney anymore.
08x11,Unknown,I-I just got done being crazy about all that.
08x11,Unknown,"I mean, why would I want to throw myself back in that pit?"
08x11,Unknown,Because you're in love with him.
08x11,Unknown,"No, I'm not."
08x11,Unknown,I'm happy for him.
08x11,Unknown,"So, it doesn't bother you that Barney Stinson's gonna propose to another woman on top of the World Wide News building?"
08x11,Unknown,"Wait, why the top of the World Wide News building?"
08x11,Unknown,I guess it's Patrice's favorite spot in the city.
08x11,Unknown,"Damn it, Patrice, that's my favorite spot in the city!"
08x11,Unknown,Whoa.
08x11,Unknown,(phone chimes)
08x11,Unknown,"Ranjit says, ""Whoa."""
08x11,Unknown,Okay... (sighs)
08x11,Unknown,"maybe that one detail stings a little bit, but that doesn't mean I'm in love with Barney."
08x11,Unknown,(phone chimes)
08x11,Unknown,"""Sounds like she's in love with Barney."""
08x11,Unknown,"Okay, is this divider even slightly soundproof?"
08x11,Unknown,(phone chimes)
08x11,Unknown,"""Yes."""
08x11,Unknown,With a little winky face.
08x11,Unknown,"Look, I... I hope it goes well for Barney."
08x11,Unknown,I really do.
08x11,Unknown,But tonight there is no place I would rather be than at your building.
08x11,Unknown,Celebrating with you.
08x11,Unknown,Are you sure?
08x11,Unknown,"Ranjit, to Teddy Westside's kick-ass building."
08x11,Unknown,I cannot hear you.
08x11,Unknown,We will be there in five minutes.
08x11,Unknown,This kid does not mean that you're special.
08x11,Unknown,It just means that you're horny and you're easy.
08x11,Unknown,"Now, come on, let me smell his head."
08x11,Unknown,"Li-Lily, Lily, no, no, no, no, come on."
08x11,Unknown,"Seriously, Ted, what is up with the floor?"
08x11,Unknown,Lily. What?
08x11,Unknown,Is it harder than we thought to be away from Marvin? Yes.
08x11,Unknown,But are we gonna have fun or are we gonna wallow in the corner like idiots?
08x11,BOTH (crying),"♪ Night, night, little Marvin"

08x11,Unknown,Hey.
08x11,Unknown,Do you realize that something you thought up in your head now exists as a part of the Manhattan skyline?
08x11,Unknown,That's huge.
08x11,Unknown,It's just a building.
08x11,Unknown,"I mean, I'm incredibly young for such an achievement, but it's just a building."
08x11,Unknown,"I mean,"
08x11,Unknown,Architecture Vision Weekly
08x11,Unknown,"may have dubbed it ""more than just a building,"" but it's just a building."
08x11,Unknown,So let's not get carried...
08x11,Unknown,"Okay, you're right, it's huge."
08x11,Unknown,It is huge.
08x11,Unknown,"You're the star of the party, and who knows?"
08x11,Unknown,Maybe the future Mrs. Ted Mosby is gonna be there.
08x11,Unknown,"Yeah, maybe she will."
08x11,Unknown,Oh.
08x11,Unknown,"Wait, this isn't your..."
08x11,Unknown,(sighs)
08x11,Unknown,This is the World Wide News building.
08x11,Unknown,Go get him.
08x11,Unknown,"I told you, I am done chasing Barney."
08x11,Unknown,Now can we please go to your party?
08x11,Unknown,"Robin, do you want to spend tonight making small talk with a bunch of bankers in a daring yet refined contemporary masterpiece King Kong should feel lucky to climb..."
08x11,Unknown,...or do you want to follow your heart?
08x11,Unknown,Why do you keep insisting that I have feelings for Barney?
08x11,Unknown,(phone chimes)
08x11,Unknown,Because you do.
08x11,Unknown,"See, even Ranjit agrees."
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, he's got to pee."
08x11,Unknown,"The point is, you're not over Barney."
08x11,Unknown,That's why you freaked out about him proposing on the roof of the World Wide News building.
08x11,Unknown,I did not freak out.
08x11,Unknown,"It's just... a teeny, tiny bit annoying that I am the one who showed her that roof in the first place!"
08x11,Unknown,"Damn it, Patrice!"
08x11,Unknown,Whoa.
08x11,Unknown,(phone chimes)
08x11,Unknown,"""Never mind; I found a soda bottle."""
08x11,Unknown,"Okay, that's disturbing."
08x11,Unknown,"What do you want me to do, Ted?"
08x11,Unknown,"Run up to that roof, knock the ring out of Barney's hand, and say, ""Sorry to interrupt, but you should be with me""?"
08x11,Unknown,Is that what you want?
08x11,Unknown,No.
08x11,Unknown,I don't.
08x11,Unknown,I can't keep making an ass of myself.
08x11,Unknown,"Well, a word in defense of making an ass of yourself, it's underrated."
08x11,Unknown,"Eight years ago I made an ass of myself chasing after you, and I've made an ass of myself chasing after you a bunch of times since then."
08x11,Unknown,But I have no regrets.
08x11,Unknown,Because it led me to something that I wouldn't trade for the world.
08x11,Unknown,It led to you being my friend.
08x11,Unknown,"So, as your friend and a leading expert in the field of making an ass of yourself, I say to you from the heart, get the hell out of this car."
08x11,Unknown,(exhales)
08x11,Unknown,"But, Ted, your big night."
08x11,Unknown,It's just a building.
08x11,Unknown,(door closes)
08x11,Unknown,Barney
08x11,Unknown,The Robin.
08x11,Step one,admit to yourself that you still have feelings for this girl.
08x11,Unknown,"I am hopelessly, irretrievably in love with her."
08x11,Unknown,More than she knows.
08x11,Step two,choose the completely wrong moment to make a drunken move after hanging out at a strip club and get shot down on purpose.
08x11,Step three,"agree that you two don't work, locking the door on any future you could have together."
08x11,Unknown,I'm done trying to get you.
08x11,Unknown,I can't do it anymore.
08x11,Unknown,Which will drive Robin nuts.
08x11,Unknown,Huh.
08x11,Step four,Robin goes nuts.
08x11,Step five,find the person who annoys Robin most in the world...
08x11,Unknown,"Nobody asked for your help, Patrice!"
08x11,Unknown,...and ask for her help.
08x11,Unknown,"Oh, hi, Barney."
08x11,Unknown,What are you doing here?
08x11,Unknown,"Actually, I'm looking for you."
08x11,Unknown,"This may sound kind of weird, but I have a proposition..."
08x11,Unknown,Explain everything to Patrice and hope she agrees to help.
08x11,Unknown,Yay. I love Robin.
08x11,Unknown,Of course I'll help.
08x11,Unknown,(giggles)
08x11,Unknown,"Good, good."
08x11,Unknown,(screams)
08x11,Step six,check with your doctor about possible broken ribs.
08x11,Step seven,pretend to be dating Patrice.
08x11,Unknown,"Nobody asked you here, Patrice!"
08x11,Unknown,"Actually, I did."
08x11,Step eight,"wait until Robin inevitably breaks into your place to find the Playbook and show it to Patrice, which you'll monitor via the hidden cameras you have in your apartment."
08x11,Unknown,"Patrice, the robin's in the nest."
08x11,Unknown,That means Robin broke into my apartment Were you even listening when I explained the codes?
08x11,Step nine,"after Patrice finds the Playbook, have your first big fight."
08x11,Unknown,This is going so well.
08x11,Unknown,Thank you so much.
08x11,Unknown,"I know, but what the heck are Lily and Ted doing here?"
08x11,Unknown,I don't know. My friends have no boundaries.
08x11,Unknown,(groans)
08x11,Unknown,How can I ever thank you?
08x11,Unknown,Will you watch my cat next weekend?
08x11,Unknown,No.
08x11,Unknown,"Come on, we should probably go back inside."
08x11,Step ten,"prove your loyalty to Patrice by burning the Playbook, and actually burn it."
08x11,Unknown,You don't need it anymore.
08x11,Step 11,"because your friends have no boundaries, they'll inevitably have an intervention for Robin, which you'll monitor via the hidden cameras you have in Marshall and Lily's apartment."
08x11,Step 12,tell only Ted about your plan to propose to Patrice.
08x11,Unknown,You can't tell anybody.
08x11,Unknown,Agreed?
08x11,Step 13,"wait and see if Ted tells Robin, and if he does..."
08x11,Unknown,Barney's getting engaged.
08x11,Unknown,...it means your best bro in the world has let go of Robin and has given you his blessing.
08x11,Step 14,Robin arrives at her favorite spot in the city and finds the secret final page of the Playbook.
08x11,Unknown,The last play you'll ever run.
08x11,Step 15,Robin realizes she's standing underneath mistletoe.
08x11,Unknown,(sighs)
08x11,Unknown,"Seriously, Barney?"
08x11,Unknown,"Even you, even someone as certifiably insane as you must realize that this is too far."
08x11,Unknown,"You lied to me, manipulated me for weeks."
08x11,Unknown,Do you really think I could ever kiss you after that?
08x11,Unknown,Do you really think I could ever trust you after that?
08x11,Unknown,"This... this is proof of why we don't work, why we'll never work."
08x11,Unknown,So thank you.
08x11,Unknown,"You've set me free because... how could I be with a man who thinks that this... trick, this enormous lie could ever make me want to date him again?"
08x11,Unknown,Turn it over.
08x11,Unknown,(sighs)
08x11,Unknown,Robin Scherbatsky...

08x12,Older Ted,"With Christmas just around the corner, your Uncle Barney, gave me the horrible gift of an unwanted secret."
08x12,Barney,"Tomorrow night on the roof of the World Wide News building... that's Patrice's favorite spot... I'm gonna ask her to marry me. (Ted tries to say something) Ah, poot-tu-tat! You're jinxed. I'll unjinx you if you'll follow these two rules: one: you can't try to talk me out of it, and two: you can't tell anybody. Agreed?"
08x12,Unknown,(Ted nods.)
08x12,Older Ted,"Yeah, that nod was a lie. You see Robin had been hurting over Barney all fall. And as her friend, I knew I had to tell her. I just had to find the right moment."
08x12,Marshall,"Uh, there he is! The youngest architect ever to build a skyscraper in New York City! The shockingly still single Ted Mosby. You hear that, ladies?"
08x12,Lily,"I can't believe the GNB Tower opens tonight. Ted, your building finally gets unveiled to the whole world."
08x12,Marshall,"You hear that, ladies?"
08x12,Robin,Nervous?
08x12,Ted,Everything comes out of my body in liquid form now.
08x12,Marshall,"Ignore that, ladies."
08x12,Ted,"Plus, I, I keep having this nightmare where King Kong shows up to the opening but refuses to climb my building because, in his words, ""It's a bit derivative""."
08x12,Lily,"Oh, stop it, tonight is gonna be amazing."
08x12,Marshall,"And we are definitely gonna be there to toast you, but we might have to leave a little early if that's okay. My dad just gave us the most amazing Christmas gift ever. Our first night away since Marvin was born."
08x12,Marshall,24 hours straight without that little bastard.
08x12,Lily,We're maximizing our time away by planning everything down to the minute. See? 2:12 p.m... guilt Ted into saying it's okay if we leave early tonight.
08x12,Ted,"It's okay if you leave early tonight. Look, I just appreciate you showing up at all on your big night away. I mean, Barney's not even gonna be there."
08x12,All,What?
08x12,Lily,This is the biggest night of your career. Why isn't Barney coming?
08x12,Ted,"I don't know... he said, ""Legendary"" and ""Challenge accepted,"" and then he winked. ""Wait for it,"" you know, all that stuff."
08x12,Marshall,That does sound like him.
08x12,Lily,"Well, we're your real friends and we wouldn't miss it for the world."
08x12,Marshall,That is why we will see you tonight from 7:03 to 7:14.
08x12,Robin,"Bye, guys. Good night."
08x12,All,Bye.
08x12,RobiN,"Okay, what's the real reason Barney's not coming?"
08x12,Older Ted,Here was my chance to tell Robin about Barney.
08x12,Ted,"Yeah, actually, Barney didn't say what he was doing tonight. Anyway... you know, I'm not taking anyone to the opening, so you wanna be my date?"
08x12,Robin,Sure.
08x12,Lily,"Okay, Dad, I made you a list of Marvin's nightly schedule down to the minute."
08x12,Lily’s dad,"Okay. ""9:06 p.m... put on edible underwear""."
08x12,Lily,"Wrong list, wrong list."
08x12,Lily’s dad,"Come on, relax. I know this little guy like the back of my hand. (looks at his hand) Dear Lord, what is that? Oh, jam, okay. Just jam."
08x12,Marshall,"Oh, I forgot the lullaby. Do you know Marvin's lullaby? We sing it to him every night."
08x12,Marshall,"(singing)  Night, night, little Marvin # Stars twinkle for you # The Dreamland train's a - chuggin' # # All your dreams will come true # # And the horsie says, ""Good night"" # # And the birdie says, ""Good night"" # # And the elephant says, ""Good night"" # # And the skeleton playing his own rib cage # # Says, ""Good Night"" # And the robot says, ""Good night"" # Good night."
08x12,Unknown,(Neighbor knocking on the wall) Enough with the damn music!
08x12,Marshall (continues),"And Mr. Nesbit says, ""Good night"" # And the whole world"
08x12,Unknown,"says, ""Good night"" # Take it, Mommy."
08x12,Lily’s dad,"Got it... load him up with cough syrup, watch Breaking Bad until he conks out. Just kidding."
08x12,Marshall,We did it.
08x12,Lily,"Yeah, we did."
08x12,Marshall,"Now that we're out the door, I actually don't feel anxious. Whoa, oh, my God, it's your dad! Oh, something horrible happened... aah! Oh, it's Ted, relax."
08x12,Ted,"Bar, now."
08x12,Lily,What is it?
08x12,Marshall,He needs me.
08x12,Lily,"But, baby, what about our magical romantic night? In four minutes, we're"
08x12,Unknown,supposed to be doing hand stuff in the cab.
08x12,Marshall,I'll be quick... I'm sure it's nothing huge.
08x12,Marshall,That's huge.
08x12,Ted,"And I knew that I had to tell Robin. But? I may have... asked her to be my date instead. What is wrong with me? Deep down, is there still some crazy part of me that thinks I'm gonna wind up with Robin? Am I that deluded? If so, I need to grow up. Oh... by the way, I'm breaking a jinx swear here, so don't tell Barney or he gets to whack me in the nuts three times with a Wiffle ball bat."
08x12,Marshall,"Sure, pretty standard."
08x12,Ted,Robin deserves the chance to go after Barney one last time if that's what she wants. I'm gonna go tell her.
08x12,Marshall,One quick thing.
08x12,Ted,Yeah.
08x12,Marshall,"Don't. Hey... I'm gonna be a little while, baby. It's a long story, but Ted needs my help."
08x12,Lily,"Okay, but hurry or I'm gonna start doing number 11 on my own."
08x12,Marshall,You can do that by yourself?
08x12,Lily,"Pilates, b*tch."
08x12,Ted,"Okay, why shouldn't I tell Robin?"
08x12,Marshall,"Because deep down some crazy part of you still thinks you're gonna wind up with her, and I agree. Marshall... I'm sorry, I'm Team Tedward. Always have been, always will be. Now, listen. I want my best friend to be happy. And if Robin could mean happiness for you, then, dear God, why help her go after another man?"
08x12,Ted,"Because she might still be in love with him. To not tell her, to not give her that chance, it's... it's selfish."
08x12,Marshall,So be selfish.
08x12,Ted,I can't do that.
08x12,Marshall,"Tell that to the onion rings we just ""split""."
08x12,Ted,Robin is my friend.
08x12,Marshall,"She's always been more than that and you know it. Now, as we speak, my wife is in a hotel room cheating on me… with herself. But I'm not leaving here until you promise not to say a word about this to Robin. Now repeat after me. ""I..."""
08x12,Ted,"Well, I can do more at a time than ""I""."
08x12,Marshall,"""I, Ted Mosby, promise to stop ""putting everyone else's interests ahead of my own, and for once in my life, do what's best for me""."
08x12,Ted,"I... Sorry, what was the rest of that?"
08x12,Lily,"Hey, Dad, just taking a break from our amazing night to check in. I bet Marvin's pretty devastated that I'm not there, huh?"
08x12,Lil’s dad,Not at all... I don't think he even noticed you're gone. It's kind of like Mommy who?
08x12,Lily,"Oh... oh, good. But I should probably sing him his nighttime lullaby over the phone, just in case."
08x12,Lily’s dad,Sang it already... nailed it.
08x12,Lily,Did you do the horsie?
08x12,Lily’s dad,Yep.
08x12,Lily,The birdie?
08x12,Lily’s dad,Yep.
08x12,Lily,Moose.
08x12,Lily’s dad,"No moose, trick question."
08x12,Lily,Robot.
08x12,Lily’s dad,"Affirmative. Look, I should go. Marvin's asleep in my arms. Mmm, his head smells like love. Bye."
08x12,Ted,Whoa.
08x12,Ranjit,Hello... and hubba-hubba.
08x12,Robin,"Aw, thanks. But tonight is about my main man Mosby."
08x12,Ranjit,Really? Why?
08x12,Robin,"Oh, Ted, tell Ranjit the huge thing that's happening tonight."
08x12,Ted,Barney's getting engaged.
08x12,Ranjit,Ranjit out.
08x12,Robin,Bar-Barney's getting engaged?
08x12,Ted,"He asked me to keep it a secret, but I thought you deserved to know... in case you wanted to do something about it. Do you?"
08x12,Ranjit,"Do you, Robin?"
08x12,Ted,"Ranjit, a little privacy, please?"
08x12,Ranjit,"Sorry, not listening."
08x12,Lily (trips),"Nice, uneven floor there, Ted."
08x12,Marshall,"Lily, are you drunk?"
08x12,Lily,What? I... I'm on vacation. I may have cracked open the minibar to celebrate. Who invited the narc?
08x12,Marshall,"Hey, listen, I know that you miss Marvin, but it's not like we could've brought him to a black-tie event anyway."
08x12,Lily,"Yeah, these parents are so lame and-and clingy."
08x12,Marshall,"Yeah, it's like, cut the cord already, right, guys?"
08x12,Lily,"Yeah, yeah, that baby's not even cute."
08x12,Marshall,Super ugly baby. It's almost physically repulsive.
08x12,Both (looking at the baby),Aw... Aw...
08x12,Lily,"Great, I just started lactating."
08x12,Marshall,"Me, too."
08x12,Ted,"So, what do you want to do?"
08x12,Ranjit,"Robin, I do not want to meddle, but this is like the classic love song says... (starts singing Indian song)"
08x12,Ted,"Ranjit. Ranjit, let's just communicate via text from now on, okay?"
08x12,Robin,"I appreciate what you're doing. But I'm not chasing after Barney anymore. I just got done being crazy about all that. I mean, why would I want to throw myself back in that pit?"
08x12,Ted,Because you're in love with him.
08x12,Robin,"No, I'm not. I'm happy for him."
08x12,Ted,"So, it doesn't bother you that Barney Stinson's gonna propose to another woman on top of the World-Wide News building?"
08x12,Robin,"Wait, why the top of the World-Wide News building?"
08x12,Ted,I guess it's Patrice's favorite spot in the city.
08x12,Robin,"Damn it, Patrice, that's my favorite spot in the city!"
08x12,Ted,"Whoa. (gets a text) Ranjit says, ""Whoa""."
08x12,Robin,"Okay... maybe that one detail stings a little bit, but that doesn't mean I'm in love with Barney."
08x12,Ted (gets a text again),"""Sounds like she's in love with Barney""."
08x12,Ted,"Okay, is this divider even slightly soundproof? (gets a text again) ""Yes"". With a little winky face."
08x12,Robin,"Look, I... I hope it goes well for Barney. I really do. But tonight there is no"
08x12,Unknown,place I would rather be than at your building. Celebrating with you.
08x12,Lily,"This kid does not mean that you're special. It just means that you're horny and you're easy. Now, come on, let me smell his head."
08x12,Marshall,"Li-Lily, Lily, no, no, no, no, come on."
08x12,Lily,"Seriously, Ted, what is up with the floor?"
08x12,Marshall,Lily.
08x12,Lily,What?
08x12,Marshall,Is it harder than we thought to be away from Marvin? Yes. But are we gonna have fun or are we gonna wallow in the corner like idiots?
08x12,Lily and Marshall (in the corner),"# Night, night, little Marvin # Stars twinkle for you # The Dreamland train's a - chuggin' # # All your dreams # Will come true."
08x12,Robin,Hey. Do you realize that something you thought up in your head now exists as a part of the Manhattan skyline? That's huge.
08x12,Ted,"It's just a building. I mean, I'm incredibly young for such an achievement, but it's just a building. I mean, Architecture Vision Weekly may have dubbed it ""more than just a building,"" but it's just a building. So, let's not get carried... Okay, you're right, it's huge."
08x12,Robin,"It is huge. You're the star of the party, and who knows? Maybe the future Mrs. Ted Mosby is gonna be there."
08x12,Ted,"Yeah, maybe she will."
08x12,Robin,"Oh. Wait, this isn't your... This is the World-Wide News building."
08x12,Ted,Go get him.
08x12,Robin,I told you. I am done chasing Barney. Now can we please go to your party?
08x12,Ted,"Robin, do you want to spend tonight making small talk with a bunch of bankers in a daring yet refined contemporary masterpiece King Kong should feel lucky to climb... or do you want to follow your heart?"
08x12,Robin,Why do you keep insisting that I have feelings for Barney?
08x12,Ted,"Because you do. (gets text) See, even Ranjit agrees. Oh, he's got to pee."
08x12,Unknown,"The point is, you're not over Barney. That's why you freaked out about him proposing on the roof of the World-Wide News building."
08x12,Robin,"I did not freak out. It's just... a teeny, tiny bit annoying that I am the one who showed her that roof in the first place! Damn it, Patrice!"
08x12,Ted,Whoa.
08x12,Ranjit,"""Never mind, I found a soda bottle""."
08x12,Ted,"Okay, that's disturbing."
08x12,Robin,"What do you want me to do, Ted? Run up to that roof, knock the ring out of Barney's hand, and say, ""Sorry to interrupt, but you should be with me""?"
08x12,Ted,Is that what you want?
08x12,Robin,No. I don't. I can't keep making an ass of myself.
08x12,Unknown,"Ted. Well, a word in defense of making an ass of yourself, it's underrated. Eight years ago, I made an ass of myself chasing after you, and I've made an ass of myself chasing after you a bunch of times since then. But I have no regrets. Because it led me to something that I wouldn't trade for the world. It led to you being my friend. So, as your friend and a leading expert in the field of making an ass of yourself, I say to you from the heart, get the hell out of this car."
08x12,Robin,"But, Ted, your big night."
08x12,Ted,It's just a building.
08x12,Unknown,(Robin reads) The Robin.
08x12,Barney,Step one: admit to yourself that you still have feelings for this girl.
08x12,Unknown,Flashback
08x12,Barney,"I am hopelessly, irretrievably in love with her. More than she knows."
08x12,Barney,Step two: choose the completely wrong moment to make a drunken move after hanging out at a strip club and get shot down on purpose.
08x12,Step three,"agree that you two don't work, locking the door on any future you could have together.</i>"
08x12,Unknown,Flashaback
08x12,Barney,I'm done trying to get you. I can't do it anymore.
08x12,Barney,Which will drive Robin nuts.
08x12,Robin,Huh.
08x12,Barney,Step four: Robin goes nuts.
08x12,Step five,Find the person who annoys Robin most in the world...
08x12,Robin,"Nobody asked for your help, Patrice!"
08x12,Barney,and ask for her help.
08x12,Patrice,"Oh, hi, Barney. What are you doing here?"
08x12,Barney,"Actually, I'm looking for you. This may sound kind of weird, but I have a proposition..."
08x12,Barney,Explain everything to Patrice and hope she agrees to help.
08x12,Patrice,"Yay. I love Robin. Of course, I'll help."
08x12,Barney,"Good, good."
08x12,Unknown,(Patrice hugs him and lifts him up.)
08x12,Step six,check with your doctor about possible broken ribs.
08x12,Step seven,pretend to be dating Patrice.
08x12,Robin,"Nobody asked you here, Patrice!"
08x12,Barney,"Actually, I did."
08x12,Step eight,wait until Robin inevitably breaks into your place to find the Playbook and
08x12,Unknown,"show it to Patrice, which you'll monitor via the hidden cameras you have in your apartment."
08x12,Barney,"Patrice, the robin's in the nest. That means Robin broke into my apartment Were you even listening when I explained the codes?"
08x12,Step nine,"after Patrice finds the Playbook, have your first big fight."
08x12,Barney,This is going so well.  Thank you so much.
08x12,Patrice,"I know, but what the heck are Lily and Ted doing here?"
08x12,Barney,I don't know. My friends have no boundaries. How can I ever thank you?
08x12,Patrice,Will you watch my cat next weekend?
08x12,Barney,"No. Come on, we should probably go back inside."
08x12,Step ten,"prove your loyalty to Patrice by burning the Playbook, and actually burn it. You don't need it anymore."
08x12,Step 11,"because your friends have no boundaries, they'll inevitably have an intervention for Robin, which you'll monitor via the hidden camera you have in Marshall"
08x12,Unknown,and Lily's apartment.
08x12,Step 12,tell only Ted about your plan to propose to Patrice.</i>
08x12,Barney,You can't tell anybody. Agreed?
08x12,Step 13,"wait and see if Ted tells Robin, and if he does..."
08x12,Ted,Barney's getting engaged.
08x12,Barney,it means your best bro in the world has let go of Robin and
08x12,Unknown,has given you his blessing.
08x12,Step 14,Robin arrives at her favorite spot in the city and finds the secret final page of the Playbook. The last play you'll ever run.
08x12,Step 15,Robin realizes she's standing underneath mistletoe.
08x12,Robin,"Seriously, Barney? Even you, even someone as certifiably insane as you must realize that this is too far. You lied to me, manipulated me for weeks. Do you really think I could ever kiss you after that? Do you really think I could ever trust you after that? This... this is proof of why we don't work, why we'll never work. So, thank you. You've set me free because... how could I be with a man who thinks that this... trick, this enormous lie could ever make me want to date him again?"
08x12,Barney,Turn it over. Robin Scherbatsky... will you marry me?
08x12,Robin,Yes.
08x12,Man,"And so, let's all raise a glass to Ted Mosby. None of this would have been possible without him. To Ted."
08x12,All,To Ted.
08x12,Unknown,THE END
08x13,Unknown,Narrator
08x13,,"Kids, in late 2012,"
08x13,Unknown,"I received a very important text message. Uncle Barney and Aunt Robin were engaged, marking a truly happy time for our little group. The problem was one of us was definitely not happy."
08x13,Unknown,(crying)
08x13,Unknown,Marvin will not stop crying.
08x13,Unknown,What do you guys think it is?
08x13,Unknown,Is he hungry?
08x13,Unknown,"Well, that must be it."
08x13,Unknown,Huh!
08x13,Unknown,"Thank you for thinking of that, Ted."
08x13,Unknown,And here we were just watering him and facing him towards the sunlight.
08x13,Unknown,"Sorry, I haven't slept in..."
08x13,Unknown,January.
08x13,Unknown,Marshall
08x13,,"Food going in isn't the problem, it's what's coming out, or not coming out."
08x13,Unknown,He hasn't pooped in three days.
08x13,Unknown,Lily
08x13,,"Yeah, normally I wouldn't wish one of his dirty diapers on my worst enemy, but now I kind of miss popping the hood in the morning and finding that first big juicy, black..."
08x13,Unknown,"Lily, I'm eating chili."
08x13,Unknown,"I'm eating chili, Lily."
08x13,Unknown,Confetti.
08x13,Unknown,Big blast of confetti.
08x13,Unknown,"Normally, the kid's a confetti machine."
08x13,Unknown,He's Rip Taylor in a diaper.
08x13,Unknown,Marshall
08x13,,"I have a feeling at this point, Rip Taylor is Rip Taylor in a diaper."
08x13,Unknown,"And with that image, dinner is done."
08x13,Unknown,"Hey, guys."
08x13,Unknown,"Hey. Well, well, well."
08x13,Unknown,Here comes the bride.
08x13,Unknown,"Now the annoying part, right?"
08x13,Unknown,Planning the wedding?
08x13,Unknown,"So not fun, right?"
08x13,Unknown,I don't know-- I'm kind of looking forward to it.
08x13,Unknown,"Fine, I'll do it for you."
08x13,Unknown,First thing we need to do is set a date.
08x13,Unknown,"May 25, 2013."
08x13,Unknown,"Thank you, Ted."
08x13,Unknown,The ladies are talking.
08x13,Unknown,"Actually, that is the date."
08x13,Unknown,Ted offered to help with the planning a little.
08x13,Unknown,"And, well, uh..."
08x13,Unknown,That's a big binder.
08x13,Unknown,"Oh, this?"
08x13,Unknown,This is just cakes.
08x13,Unknown,"Anyway, we're having the ceremony at that beautiful little church out on Long Island, where Victoria almost got married-- lovely spot."
08x13,Unknown,And then we're gonna have a reception in a big white tent on the front lawn of the hotel.
08x13,Unknown,"Oh, and, uh, the colors are cream and lilac."
08x13,Unknown,"I will cut you, b*tch."
08x13,Unknown,"No, L-L-Lily..."

08x13,,"Hey, Robin, where's Barney?"
08x13,Unknown,Did he skip town already?
08x13,Unknown,"If so, exactly what time was it?"
08x13,Unknown,It's important for the over/under.
08x13,Unknown,"Barney's fine, it's just... well, earlier this morning..."
08x13,Unknown,"So, it's been three days since I said yes."
08x13,Unknown,True.
08x13,Unknown,And your panic att*cks are getting shorter and further apart.
08x13,Unknown,I can't do this! I feel like I'm drowning!
08x13,Unknown,Also true.
08x13,Unknown,So I guess we're officially engaged.
08x13,Unknown,Maybe we should tell our parents.
08x13,Unknown,I assume my dad already knows--
08x13,Unknown,"you did call him and got his permission, right?"
08x13,Unknown,(laughs)
08x13,Unknown,"Yeah, yeah, Robin."

08x13,Unknown,"Uh, he's gonna put you in a cage. and send you on horseback to my remote desert camp."
08x13,Unknown,"Okay, Barney... Hold on, I'm not done."
08x13,Unknown,Where you'll be bathed in perfumes and oils and delivered to my tent.

08x13,Unknown,"No, I did not."
08x13,Unknown,"So, as some of you know, my dad is a little scary."
08x13,Unknown,A little? Dude's a stone cold Slytherin.
08x13,Unknown,He always looks like he just came from slapping some guy tied to a chair in a back room.
08x13,Unknown,"Anyway, we go get lunch..."
08x13,Unknown,"Look, I know I already told you this, but my dad is a scary guy."

08x13,Unknown,I... you...

08x13,Unknown,"Oh, right, you haven't met Carol, um..."

08x13,Unknown,Very special woman.
08x13,Unknown,"48 years old, dental hygienist, no kids."
08x13,Unknown,Likes Zumba.
08x13,Unknown,She's the reason I moved to New York City.
08x13,Unknown,"Eight months ago. Thanks for the call, by the way."
08x13,Unknown,"Well, I figured you knew."
08x13,Unknown,It's on my Facebook page.
08x13,Unknown,You really should respond to my friend request.

08x13,Unknown,But Carol has brought out a whole new side of me.
08x13,Unknown,"I have a new outlook on life a devil-may-care insouciance that embodies the credo, ""No shirt, no shoes, no problem."""
08x13,Unknown,Robin...
08x13,Unknown,I'm fun now.
08x13,Unknown,(all groaning)
08x13,Unknown,"Oh, God."
08x13,Unknown,He's fun now? That does not sound fun.
08x13,Unknown,No child should have to see a parent go through that.
08x13,Unknown,"Well, it probably took some of the pressure off the Barney of it all."
08x13,Unknown,"Sir, hi."
08x13,Unknown,My name is Barney Stinson.
08x13,Unknown,This is Barney?
08x13,Unknown,This man is blond.
08x13,Unknown,Grown men are not blond.
08x13,Unknown,Dad.
08x13,Unknown,Pleased to meet you.
08x13,Unknown,That's a very... fun hair color.
08x13,Unknown,"That's nothing-- when he met me, his first words were, ""Nice blouse"""" You were wearing a blouse."
08x13,Unknown,It was not a blouse!
08x13,Unknown,"Oh, great. You're all here."
08x13,Unknown,Let's talk about our wedding band.
08x13,Unknown,"How much do you guys think they should rock? 'Cause I vote, a million."
08x13,Unknown,"Yeah, yeah, I think we already settled on a DJ, so..."
08x13,Unknown,Barney
08x13,,"Lily, do you remember the band you guys almost hired for your wedding?"
08x13,Unknown,Remember them?
08x13,Unknown,I'll call them up and book them for you.
08x13,Unknown,Just say the word.
08x13,Unknown,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel like we keep coming back to this DJ thing."
08x13,Unknown,"What do you think, baby?"
08x13,Unknown,"Yeah, I don't think anyone should book anything right now."
08x13,Unknown,Why not?
08x13,Unknown,"Well, I am going to go the room marked ""Spaghettis,"" which I'm hoping is the ladies room. ""Meatballs"" has to be men's, right?"
08x13,Unknown,"I don't know what the hell ""Calamaris"" is."
08x13,Unknown,(mouthing)
08x13,Unknown,(anxious laugh)
08x13,Unknown,Um...
08x13,Unknown,"Sir, I-I-I..."
08x13,Unknown,Permission denied.
08x13,Unknown,Ooh.
08x13,Unknown,"And it turns out, ""spaghettis"" are men."
08x13,Unknown,I saw a noodle.
08x13,Unknown,Marshall
08x13,,He said no?
08x13,Unknown,"Yeah, I don't know what we're gonna do."
08x13,Unknown,"Relax, baby. I got this."
08x13,Unknown,I know how to be persuasive.
08x13,Unknown,Narrator
08x13,Unknown,"The next day, Uncle Barney met Robin's dad for lunch at the same restaurant."
08x13,Unknown,"This time, with a plan."
08x13,Unknown,"Hello, Mr. Scherbatsky."
08x13,Unknown,I think we got off on the wrong foot.
08x13,Unknown,You have my attention.
08x13,Unknown,I left the meatball at home so I could talk to you spaghetti to spaghetti.
08x13,Unknown,Sir...
08x13,Unknown,I'm very serious about marrying your daughter.
08x13,Unknown,"Barney, when I wanted to marry Robin's mother, I slaughtered a whole family of bears with my bare hands."
08x13,Unknown,I gave the pelts and the bear meat to her father as tribute.
08x13,Unknown,You know what we call that in Canada?
08x13,Unknown,Manners.
08x13,Unknown,Man
08x13,,Would either of you like a mudslide?
08x13,Unknown,I just had one. Thank you.
08x13,Unknown,I'll have a Jazzy Pizzazzy Razzleberry Rainbow Milkshake with a swirly straw?
08x13,Unknown,You didn't say the magic word.
08x13,Unknown,I'll go get your drink.
08x13,Unknown,(Marvin crying)
08x13,Unknown,"Still crying, huh?"
08x13,Unknown,Yeah. We've tried everything short of a pack of smokes and a cup of coffee.
08x13,Unknown,Still nothing but clean dipeys.
08x13,Unknown,There's only one explanation for this.
08x13,Unknown,Marvin has potty-trained himself.
08x13,Unknown,He sneaks into the bathroom while we're sleeping.
08x13,Unknown,I'll ask Barney to check the tapes.
08x13,Unknown,Barney has cameras in our bathroom?!
08x13,Unknown,"Well, I mean, don't you think?"
08x13,Unknown,"Hey, guys. Robin, good."
08x13,Unknown,You're here. Bad news.
08x13,Unknown,That wedding band you wanted is booked for May 25.
08x13,Unknown,"Oh, no. What are you gonna do?"
08x13,Unknown,"Oh! Oh, hey! Here's an idea."
08x13,Unknown,"Oh, God, Ted, if you suggest a DJ..."
08x13,Unknown,Far from it.
08x13,Unknown,I was going to suggest a band.
08x13,Unknown,A band called... Kool and the g*ng.
08x13,Unknown,"Robin, would you like for me to get Kool and the g*ng to play at your wedding?"
08x13,Unknown,"Uh... I... yeah, guess so."
08x13,Unknown,"And would it be okay if they invited their friends, Beyonce and-and ABBA, and the Bee Gees, and Journey, and Queen?"
08x13,Unknown,What? You're...? What are you say...?
08x13,Unknown,How... how is that even possible?
08x13,Unknown,I'll tell you how.
08x13,Unknown,You hire a DJ.
08x13,Unknown,Wicka-wicka-wicka-burn.
08x13,Unknown,Robin
08x13,,"Ugh! God, this is, like, the fifteenth time my dad has sent me a friend request."
08x13,Unknown,"I'm just gonna hit ""accept."""
08x13,Unknown,"No, no, no. No, no, no, no, don't do it, Robin."
08x13,Unknown,You don't want to see what's behind that door.
08x13,Unknown,What are you talking about?
08x13,Unknown,"He's talking about my mom's 2,000-word review of"
08x13,Unknown,Fifty Shades of Grey.
08x13,Unknown,"And 14 of those words were ""vulva."""
08x13,Unknown,You're gonna get endless requests to play some game that has something to do with gangsters and farming.
08x13,Unknown,Never mind the embarrassing cheerleading photos from high school.
08x13,Begged my mom to burn those. TED,"Robin, trust me, no good can come from accepting that friend request."
08x13,Unknown,"Yeah, I-I think I may have given you guys the wrong impression."
08x13,Unknown,"Okay, my dad is actually not that bad of a guy."
08x13,Unknown,"Do it, Barney. Squeeze that trigger."
08x13,Unknown,I don't want to do this.
08x13,Unknown,"Well, you think I wanted to k*ll that bear?"
08x13,Unknown,"Yeah, kind of. Oh, yeah, you're right."
08x13,Unknown,(whimpers)
08x13,Unknown,I can't do this.
08x13,Unknown,(sighs)
08x13,Unknown,(sobbing)
08x13,Unknown,Oh.
08x13,Unknown,What... what the hell is this?!
08x13,Unknown,Your dad is crazy!
08x13,Unknown,He wanted me to k*ll Fluffernutter!
08x13,Unknown,I told you not to give him a name!
08x13,Unknown,"Well, I did!"
08x13,Unknown,I gave him a name and a backstory!
08x13,Unknown,He comes from a magical rabbit warren underneath the old rusty tractor.
08x13,Unknown,"He was the runt of the litter, but he persevered."
08x13,Unknown,"He... Oh, give me this. Give it to me!"
08x13,Unknown,"Dad, is there, um, something you want to tell me?"
08x13,Unknown,(sighs heavily)
08x13,Unknown,"Well, in the early '80s, I did some wet work for the CIA."
08x13,Unknown,"Yes, Daddy, I remember the bedtime stories."
08x13,Unknown,"No, I'm, uh, talking about your Facebook page?"
08x13,Unknown,It says you're married.
08x13,Unknown,"Well... yes, uh, Carol and I were in Key Largo at a performance of the recording artist James Buffett."
08x13,Unknown,We're what are known as Parrotheads.
08x13,Unknown,"And, uh, well, one thing led to the other, and, uh... we got married."
08x13,Unknown,You didn't want to tell me about it?
08x13,Unknown,I Facebooked it... on Facebook.
08x13,Unknown,"Okay, you know what, Dad?"
08x13,"Since you obviously have no interest in involving me in your personal life, I may as well tell you",Barney and I are already engaged.
08x13,Unknown,That's right.
08x13,Unknown,"I'm behind you on this, Robin."
08x13,Unknown,Directly behind you.
08x13,Unknown,"Anyway, this is happening."
08x13,Unknown,"And since I wasn't invited to your wedding, you're not invited to mine."
08x13,Unknown,Good-bye.
08x13,Unknown,(door shuts)
08x13,Unknown,"Oh, no!"
08x13,Unknown,Fluffernutter peed all over my pants!
08x13,Unknown,(Marvin crying)
08x13,Unknown,"So, I just called up that wedding band's road manager to get the number of the people who booked them for the 25th, so I could bribe them into giving up the band."
08x13,Unknown,You did what?! That is so dishonest!
08x13,Unknown,"No matter what happens next, I think we can all agree, you're in the wrong here, Lily."
08x13,Unknown,"It's your number, Ted."
08x13,Unknown,"All right, you got me!"
08x13,Unknown,I put a non-refundable deposit on that band to keep Barney and Robin from booking them.
08x13,Unknown,And I would've gotten away with it if it wasn't a really stupid and expensive plan.
08x13,Unknown,"Dude, why would you do that?"
08x13,Unknown,I don't see what the big deal is.
08x13,Unknown,"The big deal is Robin deserves better than some crappy, unreliable band!"
08x13,"Sure, bands seem cool with their nice suits and their well-rehearsed moves, but let's be honest",bands let you down.
08x13,Unknown,"They-They cheat, they deceive, and God knows they've slept with every girl in New York City."
08x13,Unknown,"I just, I can't believe Robin is going through with marrying... the idea of getting a band."
08x13,Unknown,"And that is, that's a perfectly normal way to phrase that."
08x13,Unknown,"Okay, Ted, bar. Now."
08x13,Unknown,Nice try.
08x13,Unknown,"You're gonna stick me with that baby so that you guys can spend five minutes sorting out his love life, followed by an hour of you getting drunk and pretending to be in"
08x13,Unknown,The Departed.
08x13,Unknown,"You know what? I'm sorry, Lily, okay?"
08x13,But I just need to know,(Boston accent): Are you a cop? I'm not a cop!
08x13,Unknown,Are you a cop? I'm not a cop!
08x13,Unknown,Uh-uh.
08x13,Unknown,I got this.
08x13,Unknown,"Ted, you, me, upstairs."
08x13,Unknown,Roof. Now.
08x13,Unknown,What? It's January. Move!
08x13,Unknown,(Marvin coos)
08x13,Unknown,Let's cut the crap.
08x13,Unknown,We're both freezing--
08x13,Unknown,just say it and we can go downstairs.
08x13,Unknown,Say what?
08x13,Unknown,Say how much you hate that Robin and Barney are getting married.
08x13,Unknown,What? No. I...
08x13,Unknown,I'm happy for them.
08x13,Unknown,I-I encouraged Robin to go after Barney.
08x13,Unknown,I know-- because you thought you were okay letting her go.
08x13,Unknown,"But now that she's really gone, it hurts."
08x13,Unknown,Narrator
08x13,,"Kids, at that point in my life,"
08x13,Unknown,I'd been hurt quite a few times already.
08x13,Unknown,"Today, we're gonna braid friendship bracelets."
08x13,Unknown,"(Ted grunts, groans)"
08x13,Unknown,(woman yelps)
08x13,Unknown,(Ted grunts)
08x13,Unknown,♪ I fell in love...
08x13,Unknown,There is a very simple explana... ah!
08x13,Unknown,"This one time, I was playing tennis, and..."
08x13,Unknown,(screams)
08x13,Unknown,Ooh!
08x13,Unknown,"Oh, ow! Ow!"

08x13,Unknown,(choking)
08x13,Unknown,"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake?"
08x13,Unknown,Unbelievable!
08x13,Unknown,(Ted groans)
08x13,Unknown,(Barney laughs)
08x13,Unknown,(shrieking)
08x13,Unknown,Do you love me?
08x13,Unknown,No.
08x13,Unknown,Narrator
08x13,Unknown,"(grunting, screaming, choking)"
08x13,Unknown,Unbelievable!
08x13,Unknown,"(grunts, shrieks)"
08x13,Unknown,No.
08x13,Unknown,...times a million.
08x13,Unknown,I am happy for them.
08x13,Unknown,"Is all you'll let yourself say out loud, because if you said anything to the contrary, well, that would make you the most awful person on this rooftop."
08x13,Unknown,"So, I'm gonna give you an out."
08x13,Unknown,And how are you gonna do that?
08x13,Unknown,By saying something that is even more awful.
08x13,Unknown,Like what?
08x13,Unknown,(sighs)
08x13,Unknown,Sometimes I wish I wasn't a mom.
08x13,Unknown,Sometimes I want to pack a bag and leave in the middle of the night and not come back.
08x13,Unknown,"Robin shouldn't be with Barney, she should be with me."
08x13,Unknown,(sighing)
08x13,Unknown,You serious?
08x13,Unknown,I don't know.
08x13,Unknown,"I mean, I love being a mom, and..."
08x13,Unknown,I love Marvin so much.
08x13,Unknown,But... but do you remember when I wanted to be an artist?
08x13,Unknown,Art was my whole life.
08x13,Unknown,And-and now it's been months since I've even picked up a brush.
08x13,Unknown,"I-I spend the whole day taking care of kids at my job, and I come home and it's more of the same."
08x13,Unknown,It just...
08x13,Unknown,(sighs)
08x13,Unknown,"It never lets up, it..."
08x13,Unknown,"It's just really, really hard, Ted."
08x13,Unknown,Have you talked to Marshall about how you feel?
08x13,Unknown,Have you talked to Robin about how you feel?
08x13,Unknown,(sighs)
08x13,Unknown,Fair enough.
08x13,Unknown,"I just think we have to accept our lots in life, and I have to be a mom to a... a beautiful, wonderful--"
08x13,Unknown,if slightly constipated--
08x13,Unknown,"little boy, and... you have to let Robin and Barney get a band."
08x13,Unknown,"All right, let's see what's in this dipey."
08x13,Unknown,Nothing.
08x13,Unknown,Absolutely nothing.
08x13,Unknown,Hey.
08x13,Unknown,Are you finally giving Daddy a smile?
08x13,Unknown,Oh!
08x13,Unknown,"Oh, God!"
08x13,Unknown,Narrator
08x13,Unknown,"And, no, it wasn't confetti."
08x13,Unknown,Oh!
08x13,Unknown,"Oh, God!"
08x13,Unknown,Please!
08x13,Unknown,Holy confetti.
08x13,Unknown,Narrator
08x13,Unknown,"That night, Robin agreed"
08x13,Unknown,to meet her dad one more time.
08x13,Unknown,Your Dad has something to say.
08x13,Unknown,(Robin Sr. clears throat)
08x13,Unknown,(clears throat again)
08x13,Unknown,I'm sorry for getting married without consulting you.
08x13,Unknown,It was wrong of me.
08x13,Unknown,"There. Now, Robin..."
08x13,Unknown,I know that no mere apology will fix this.
08x13,Unknown,And that is why I've asked Carol for a divorce.
08x13,Unknown,What?!
08x13,Unknown,"She's heartbroken, understandably."
08x13,Unknown,Possibly suicidal.
08x13,Unknown,I did not tell him...
08x13,Unknown,But if that's the price for my daughter's love... then I will gladly let Carol pay it.
08x13,Unknown,(sighs)
08x13,Unknown,Was that not what you wanted?
08x13,Unknown,You want to know what I want?
08x13,Unknown,(grunts)
08x13,Unknown,A normal dad. That's all.
08x13,Unknown,I want you to give this blond guy permission to marry me.
08x13,Unknown,"Come to the wedding, give me away, smile in the pictures, and then... dance with me like a normal dad."
08x13,Unknown,"Is that too much to ask? ""Of course not. ""Oh, Robin, my darling girl, ""of course I'll do all stuff. ""I love you and I'm proud of you."""
08x13,Unknown,He didn't say that?
08x13,Unknown,No.
08x13,Unknown,Fine. One dance--
08x13,Unknown,"""Cheeseburger in Paradise."""
08x13,Unknown,And Carol's going to sing it.
08x13,Unknown,"Well, see you at the wedding."
08x13,Unknown,But it's kind of amazing.
08x13,Unknown,"I mean, he's never apologized to me in his life."
08x13,Unknown,Barney made it happen.
08x13,Unknown,He must really love me.
08x13,Unknown,"Well, he'd be crazy not to."
08x13,Unknown,I'm really happy for you guys.
08x13,Unknown,But I still think you should get a DJ.
08x13,Unknown,"Ju-Ju.. For God's sakes, Ted."
08x13,Unknown,Hear me out.
08x13,Unknown,Narrator
08x13,Unknown,"I made a pretty strong case that night, but in the end, she didn't want a DJ."
08x13,Unknown,She wanted a band.
08x13,Unknown,And guess what happened.
08x13,Unknown,"That's right, the band cancelled at the last minute, just like I said they would."
08x13,Unknown,"The wedding is in a week, and no bands."
08x13,Unknown,When will people realize I always know what's what?
08x13,Unknown,He says to the lesbian he dated for a month.
08x13,Unknown,That's a fair point.
08x13,Unknown,"Anyway, you guys wouldn't, uh, happen to know of any good wedding bands available at the last minute, would you?"
08x13,Unknown,"Ted, do you believe in destiny?"
08x13,Unknown,"You really don't know me, do you?"
08x13,Unknown,We just had brunch with my ex-roommate.
08x13,Unknown,The bass player?
08x13,Unknown,"No, she's not just a bass player."
08x13,Unknown,She's a bass player in the best wedding band in the tri-state area.
08x13,Unknown,"They had a gig lined up for this weekend, but it just fell through this morning."
08x13,Unknown,"You, my friend, are gonna save that wedding."
08x13,Unknown,Do you know any DJs?
08x13,Unknown,"Dude, come on."

08x14,Unknown,You guys. You guys will not believe what just happened.
08x14,Unknown,"On my way here, a taxi jumped the curb and it pinned this old lady, and I-I just went into this, like, crazy adrenaline mode and I somehow lifted it off her."
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, my God, Ted, your wrist."
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen."
08x14,Unknown,"I must've strained it lifting. No, I believe our dear friend Lily was referring to your other wrist."
08x14,Unknown,The one wearing the male birth control.

08x14,Unknown,"Yeah, you know what, guys? Leave him alone."
08x14,Unknown,"All right, he's a hero."
08x14,Unknown,Thank you.
08x14,Unknown,Do you think that your super strength came from wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?
08x14,Unknown,(laughter)
08x14,Unknown,"Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff, I have a date."
08x14,Unknown,With some hand lotion and the Internet?
08x14,Unknown,It is possible to love you more!
08x14,Unknown,She exists.

08x14,Unknown,Great. Bring her in.
08x14,Unknown,You know what? It's so nice out.
08x14,Unknown,Why don't... why don't we just all go for a walk.
08x14,Unknown,"It's pouring rain, Ted. I think it's pretty obvious she can't fit through the door. Mm."
08x14,Unknown,"She is a gorgeous, athletic woman. ""Athletic""? Sideburns, no cans."
08x14,Unknown,She is hot.
08x14,Unknown,"So why can't she come in, Ted?"
08x14,Unknown,She can come in.
08x14,(quietly),In six and a half months.
08x14,Unknown,Wait. Are you saying she's...
08x14,Unknown,Twenty.

08x14,The only thing that would make her more of a 20-year-old is an ironic form of transportation. BARNEY,Yeah.
08x14,Unknown,She's roller skating there.
08x14,Unknown,(laughs)
08x14,Unknown,I don't know which is more pathetic--
08x14,Unknown,that you're going out with a 20-year-old or that you bought a leather cuff to get a date with her.
08x14,Unknown,Ted
08x14,,I didn't buy this to get a date.

08x14,Unknown,Losing your key privileges?
08x14,Unknown,"It's about the 20-year-old, Ted."
08x14,Unknown,You have to bang her.
08x14,Unknown,For me!
08x14,Unknown,Why do you want me to hook up with this 20-year-old?
08x14,Unknown,I thought I disgusted you.
08x14,Unknown,"Yeah, that was all an act."
08x14,Unknown,"Look, look, look, I love Robin and she's the only girl I want to be with."
08x14,Unknown,But my body is detoxing after years of one-night stands.
08x14,Unknown,"They don't make gum or a patch for this, Ted."
08x14,Unknown,"But, hey, billion-dollar idea alert."
08x14,Unknown,(muttering indistinctly)
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."
08x14,Unknown,That's okay. I'll just buy a new dream journal.
08x14,Unknown,What-what-what are you looking for?
08x14,Unknown,Your phone.
08x14,Unknown,There's got to be some pictures of her in here.
08x14,Unknown,Damn it. No.
08x14,Unknown,Those are all worthless.
08x14,Unknown,"I need some one-night-stand material, Ted."
08x14,Unknown,"Oh. Oh. Here's your mom. Hello, Virginia."
08x14,Unknown,"Um, my mother is not one-night-stand material."
08x14,Unknown,"Yeah, you're right. It wasn't night and we weren't standing."
08x14,Unknown,Hey-oh!
08x14,Unknown,That didn't happen.
08x14,Unknown,You're right. It didn't.
08x14,Unknown,(clicks tongue)
08x14,Unknown,You just winked.
08x14,Unknown,"No, I didn't."
08x14,Unknown,(clicks tongue)
08x14,Unknown,You just did it again!
08x14,"Look, bottom line",I need you to proxy bang this girl for me.
08x14,Unknown,Be my stand-in and put your gland in.
08x14,Unknown,"Hey, wow, that'd be good on a hat."
08x14,Unknown,(sighs)
08x14,Unknown,"Barney, she's just using me for my gracefully aging body."
08x14,Unknown,You're picking now to get some self-respect?
08x14,Unknown,You once banged a blind girl by pretending to be Sean Connery.
08x14,Unknown,That was you.
08x14,(imitates Sean Connery),"Yeah, that conquest was most enjoyable."
08x14,Unknown,"I'm sorry. T-To hook up with a girl, I have to connect with her at least a little."
08x14,Unknown,Then find a connection.
08x14,Unknown,Just go simple.
08x14,Unknown,"Nothing about weird poets or buildings or any of those stupid articles you've ever e-mailed me with the subject line ""Food for thought."""
08x14,Unknown,"Please, Ted."
08x14,Unknown,I need this.
08x14,Unknown,Fine. You win.
08x14,Unknown,I'll bang a hot 20-year-old.
08x14,Unknown,(sighs)
08x14,Unknown,But I'm not gonna enjoy...
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, who am I kidding?"
08x14,Unknown,It's gonna be awesome.
08x14,Unknown,"Now, turn off the lights and go."
08x14,Unknown,Not all the way!
08x14,Unknown,"Hello. Yeah, three..."
08x14,Unknown,"Okay, normally New York is the friendliest, most affordable city in the world."
08x14,Unknown,Now it's as rude and expensive as San Francisco.
08x14,Unknown,Guys?
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, hey, that's life once you're engaged."
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, tell her, baby. Make it hurt."
08x14,Unknown,I'll be at the booth.
08x14,Unknown,My panties may or may not be on when you get there.
08x14,(whispers),They won't be!
08x14,Unknown,"Okay, what is going on with you guys?"
08x14,Unknown,It's the cuff.
08x14,Unknown,It turns out that picturing me as a loser musician with a Vicodin addiction and a beat-up van I use to steal copper wire really turns Lily's crank.
08x14,Unknown,Who knew?
08x14,Unknown,"Whoa, what-what happened to your wrist?"
08x14,Unknown,Oh. It's an allergic reaction.
08x14,Unknown,So take it off.
08x14,Unknown,"Robin, once you have a child, anything that gets you even remotely close to the possibility of sex is worth a few pus-filled blisters."
08x14,Unknown,Better the sores weep than I.
08x14,Unknown,"Hey, hold on. That sl*t just got here."
08x14,Unknown,How'd she get beer already?
08x14,Unknown,Do you see a ring on that finger?
08x14,Unknown,"Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa."
08x14,Unknown,Are you saying that this invisibility thing means I might not be able to get beer?
08x14,Unknown,I was just getting used to the idea of having to pay for coffee and bagels and rent.
08x14,Unknown,Rent? But not being able to get a beer? Unacceptable.
08x14,Unknown,(sighs)
08x14,Unknown,Excuse me.

08x14,Unknown,Later you should totally go out and buy a switchblade.
08x14,Unknown,Mm. Sure.
08x14,Unknown,"While I'm out, maybe Daddy picks up some diapers and a little mild salsa because we're low."
08x14,Unknown,(both moaning)

08x14,Unknown,"That night, the only person in worse shape than Robin was her fiancé."
08x14,(panting),"Ted, I'm desperate."
08x14,Unknown,"Earlier today, I saw that wrist cuff and I got a partial for Marshall."
08x14,Unknown,Did you bang that girl yet?
08x14,Unknown,"Don't get your hopes, or anything else, up."
08x14,Unknown,"I tried to connect with her, but everything just comes back to her weird fetish about how old I am."
08x14,Unknown,"Well, j-just go simple--"
08x14,Unknown,does she like TV?
08x14,Unknown,No.
08x14,Unknown,But I'll watch
08x14,Unknown,60 Minutes
08x14,Unknown,with you as loud and as long as you want.
08x14,Unknown,Sports?
08x14,Unknown,No.

08x14,Unknown,"Well, does she like books?"
08x14,Unknown,No.
08x14,Unknown,But I bet you do.
08x14,(quietly),Mm-hmm.
08x14,Unknown,"I bet you have a big, thick pair of bifocals."
08x14,Unknown,"She doesn't have daddy issues, she has granddaddy issues."
08x14,Unknown,I'm ending it.
08x14,Unknown,"Ted, I beg of you, don't quit on a body that won't quit."
08x14,Unknown,"Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker."
08x14,Unknown,That's going in the journal.
08x14,Unknown,Ted
08x14,,"Wait, did you steal my dream journal?"
08x14,Unknown,"No! Now, get back in there before all your teeth fall out and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School in a play you never rehearsed for."
08x14,Unknown,Bastard!
08x14,Unknown,We don't connect on a single thing. It's over.
08x14,Unknown,(beep)
08x14,Unknown,It's not...
08x14,Unknown,"Look, Carly, I got to tell you something."
08x14,Unknown,"I just, I don't see a future here."
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
08x14,Unknown,Are you dying?
08x14,(sighs),"Oh, that is so hot."
08x14,Unknown,(robotic beeping)
08x14,Unknown,Hey... is that R2-D2?
08x14,Unknown,Do you like
08x14,Unknown,Star Wars?
08x14,Unknown,I love
08x14,Unknown,Star Wars.
08x14,Unknown,"Me, too!"
08x14,Unknown,♪
08x14,Unknown,"I mean, I've only seen the new ones."
08x14,Unknown,Close enough.
08x14,Unknown,So?
08x14,Unknown,Yeah.
08x14,Unknown,I knew it! I could feel it.
08x14,Unknown,It's almost like we were hooking up with her together.
08x14,Unknown,"You felt that, right?"
08x14,Unknown,I couldn't have performed if I did.
08x14,Unknown,"Don't you see, Ted?"
08x14,Unknown,We had a bro-nnection.
08x14,Unknown,(clicking tongue)
08x14,Unknown,"All right, I got to know what she looks like--"
08x14,Unknown,show me a picture.
08x14,Unknown,"Well, normally, I'm above such things, but it's been a while, and, uh, Teddy's braggin'."
08x14,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x14,Unknown,"Okay, here she is."
08x14,Unknown,Okay. Scrolling up.
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, those are ""plow me"" heels. Nice. Uh-huh."
08x14,Unknown,The knee bruise is encouraging.
08x14,Unknown,Working our way up to those 20-year-old ta-tas.
08x14,Unknown,"Oh... gravity's cruel grasp hasn't found you yet, my sweet perky miracles."
08x14,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x14,Unknown,"Now, let's get a gander at Dirty Girl's face."
08x14,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
08x14,Unknown,(gasps)
08x14,Unknown,"Her face says, ""Ready to bone,"" am I right?"
08x14,Unknown,"I say again, am I right?"
08x14,Unknown,That's my half sister.
08x14,Unknown,Then you probably shouldn't scroll to the next picture.
08x14,Unknown,No!
08x14,Unknown,"That's my sister, Ted!"
08x14,Unknown,"Well, look, I didn't know!"
08x14,Unknown,"None of us even knew you had a sister until two years ago, including you!"
08x14,Unknown,This is just some crazy coincidence.
08x14,Unknown,"There are four million women in the city of New York, Ted, and you sleep with my sister?"
08x14,Unknown,Why would the universe do that to me?
08x14,Unknown,I don't know.
08x14,Unknown,It's not like you've ever treated women in such a way that would invite some sort of karmic retribution.
08x14,Unknown,You banged my sister!
08x14,Unknown,"My sweet, little, innocent..."
08x14,Unknown,Pierced. Really? Where?
08x14,Unknown,Don't answer that! Now I know why I felt everything you did to her last night.
08x14,Unknown,"It wasn't a bro-nnection, it was a sis-nnection!"
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
08x14,Unknown,Ted... did you...
08x14,Unknown,Big-time.
08x14,Unknown,Nice! High five!
08x14,Unknown,Wait! No! No!
08x14,Unknown,Retraction five!
08x14,Unknown,(speaks words in reverse)
08x14,Unknown,"Hey, hey, you're the one who begged for a proxy bang."
08x14,Unknown,"And while we're on the subject of family, I'm pretty sure you banged my mom-- mom beats sister."
08x14,Unknown,I never banged your mom.
08x14,Unknown,(clicks tongue)
08x14,Unknown,You just did the winking thing again!
08x14,Unknown,"No, I didn't."
08x14,Unknown,(clicks tongue)
08x14,Unknown,"Fine. Hey, Barney, let me ask you something."
08x14,Unknown,"Were you, uh, feeling a little sore this morning?"
08x14,Unknown,Especially...
08x14,Unknown,(gasps)
08x14,Unknown,Friendship over!
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, yeah."
08x14,Unknown,Who's your guitar-player-biker-
08x14,Unknown,who-couldn't-find-mild-salsa-
08x14,Unknown,but-said-screw-it-
08x14,Unknown,and-went-medium bad boy?
08x14,Unknown,(moans)
08x14,Unknown,"Marshall, your hand!"
08x14,Unknown,Narrator
08x14,Unknown,"Okay, I'm pretty sure it wasn't that bad,"
08x14,Unknown,but this is how Uncle Marshall
08x14,Unknown,likes to tell the story.
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, no, that's the cuff."
08x14,Unknown,"I'm woozy, and I can't flex my fingers..."
08x14,Unknown,(sniffs)
08x14,Unknown,...and the rotten fish smell is getting stronger.
08x14,Unknown,But I'm learning to compensate with my left.
08x14,Unknown,Is that why last night when I asked you to honka honka me you only honka'd me?
08x14,Unknown,I didn't think you noticed.
08x14,Unknown,Snap's been jealous of Crackle all day.
08x14,Unknown,Just take the cuff off.
08x14,Unknown,"No, but, baby, then all the sex will stop."
08x14,Unknown,"Marshall, you don't need a cuff for me to find you sexy."
08x14,Unknown,"All you have to do is smile, and I'm ready for you to hop on Pop."
08x14,Unknown,(chuckles softly)
08x14,Unknown,"Thanks, baby."
08x14,Unknown,Are you too woozy to do it one last time before we seek emergency medical attention?
08x14,Unknown,Only one way to find out.
08x14,Unknown,Mm.
08x14,Unknown,"I'm sorry, bro, I totally overreacted."
08x14,Unknown,You think? I can't believe you're allowed to ship a dead possum.
08x14,Unknown,He died?
08x14,Unknown,That possum was supposed to be an olive branch.
08x14,Unknown,Are you sure he's not just playing dead?
08x14,Unknown,He smells like Marshall's hand.
08x14,Unknown,"And wait, you-you forgive me?"
08x14,Unknown,"Absolutely. Hey, I got a couple ""cee-gars."""
08x14,Unknown,Get over here!
08x14,Unknown,"All right. So, where are those ""cee-gars""?"
08x14,Unknown,"Eh, we'll break 'em out in a minute."
08x14,Unknown,(knocks)
08x14,Unknown,"Hey, Barn."
08x14,Unknown,Ted?
08x14,Unknown,"Barney, what is your sister doing here?"
08x14,Unknown,"Nothing, bro. Or should I say, bro-in-law!"
08x14,Unknown,"(organ playing ""Wedding March"")"
08x14,Unknown,"(""Wedding March"" continues)"
08x14,Unknown,Congratulations!
08x14,Unknown,You're marrying my sister!
08x14,Unknown,"And you spared no expense, you big crazy!"
08x14,Unknown,"You know what? I love Barney, but this ring thing sucks."
08x14,Unknown,Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack and then apologized.
08x14,Unknown,"And I think he really, really meant it."
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers, but nothing beats the rush you get when that one special person looks at you."
08x14,Unknown,It's true.
08x14,Unknown,"Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see, and I see her brighter and more clearly than anything else in this world."
08x14,Unknown,You know what that is?
08x14,Unknown,That's love.
08x14,Unknown,And possibly alcohol mixed with some very powerful antibiotics.
08x14,Unknown,And that's how Barney sees you.
08x14,Unknown,And I know that's how you see Barney.
08x14,Unknown,"(clears throat) I'd like to start the service with a passage from Ted's dream journal. ""Drowning. ""Gasping for air."
08x14,Unknown,"No escape."""
08x14,Unknown,"Wait, is that about Vietnam?"
08x14,Unknown,It's about Whole Foods.
08x14,Unknown,Barney.
08x14,Unknown,We are not getting married.
08x14,Unknown,And those aisles are too narrow!
08x14,Unknown,Barney
08x14,,But you two have to get married--
08x14,Unknown,"otherwise, it's just a cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stand."
08x14,Unknown,"Wait, just to be clear, you're saying you're"
08x14,Unknown,opposed
08x14,Unknown,"to cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stands?"
08x14,Unknown,Yes.
08x14,Unknown,Barney... don't you see?
08x14,Unknown,Your detox is done!
08x14,Unknown,You're over one-night stands!
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, my God, you're right!"
08x14,Unknown,I'm free! Yeah.
08x14,Unknown,So if you think about it--
08x14,Unknown,but not too much--
08x14,Unknown,it's actually good that Carly and I hooked up.
08x14,Unknown,"Yeah, it's really good."
08x14,Unknown,"I mean, this guy goes at it like he's still in his 50s."
08x14,Unknown,"Hey, have a cigar, you big crazy!"
08x14,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x14,Unknown,"Hey, don't try to make this okay."
08x14,Unknown,You still slept with my sister.
08x14,Unknown,"Promise me you will never, ever do that again."
08x14,Unknown,I promise.
08x14,Unknown,(clicks tongue)
08x14,Unknown,You just winked.
08x14,Unknown,"No, I didn't."
08x14,Unknown,(clicks tongue)
08x14,Unknown,"You did it again! No, I didn't!"
08x14,Unknown,"You swear, right?"
08x14,Unknown,Yeah. Of course.
08x14,Unknown,(clicks tongue)
08x14,Unknown,Hey.
08x14,Unknown,"That night, even though she still couldn't get a beer, Robin realized the"
08x14,Unknown,true
08x14,Unknown,power of the ring.
08x14,Unknown,♪
08x14,Unknown,"Hey, Robin."
08x14,Unknown,Did you ever figure out how you're gonna get a drink at the bar now that you're engaged?
08x14,Unknown,"Oh, sure. I know a way that's gonna last forever."
08x14,Unknown,Scotch on the rocks?
08x14,Unknown,Coming right up.
08x14,Unknown,"Now, before you say anything about the hat... this new girl's ass is"
08x14,Unknown,phenomenal!
08x14,Unknown,Lily
08x14,,"Hey, Marshall, you got to see this."
08x14,Unknown,The catalog must have mixed up my order.
08x14,Unknown,You won't believe the jeans they just sent me.
08x14,Unknown,(mumbles)
08x14,Unknown,"Hilarious, right?"
08x14,Unknown,Totally.
08x14,Unknown,(laughs)
08x14,Unknown,You look like some suburban mom who drives a minivan filled with stale Cheerios and empty juice boxes...
08x14,Unknown,(laughs)
08x14,Unknown,probably makes chili mac and Frito pie for dinner... smells like that menthol cigarette that she snuck while she was waiting to pick her kids up from hockey practice. Get over here!
08x15,Unknown,Narrator
08x15,Unknown,"Kids, sometimes when you're about to give up on your love life forever for the 17th time, destiny intervenes."
08x15,Unknown,"Instead of rushing in, I took my time to think up the perfect opening line."
08x15,Unknown,(train brakes screech)
08x15,Unknown,"Wait, no, damn it, come back! You're really..."
08x15,Unknown,You're pretty!
08x15,Unknown,"And before I could call out after her, in any kind of embarrassing way that a bunch of teenagers made fun of for the next five stops while I stared straight ahead and pretended not to hear them, she was gone."
08x15,But here's the thing about Ted Mosby,he doesn't give up.
08x15,Unknown,(imitates blaring alarm)
08x15,Unknown,Stalker Ted alert.
08x15,Unknown,"Repeat, Stalker Ted alert."
08x15,Unknown,Already has a yellow legal pad going.
08x15,Unknown,"Repeat, already has a yellow legal pad going."
08x15,Unknown,I'm not stalking.
08x15,Unknown,I just jotted down a few details to help me find her.
08x15,Unknown,"Uh, like the fact that her smile was cute, but a bit crooked, which can be a sign of teeth grinding."
08x15,Unknown,"So I called up the city's top five TMJ specialists, and here's where it gets interesting."
08x15,Unknown,"Not interesting, Ted, creepy."
08x15,Unknown,Let her go.
08x15,Unknown,"No, this is destiny."
08x15,Unknown,"No, Ted, this is forcing it."
08x15,Unknown,"When Lily and I met, I mean, that was destiny."
08x15,Unknown,Marshall
08x15,Unknown,"She could've knocked on any door to find someone to fix her stereo, but she knocked on mine."
08x15,Unknown,Now hand over the pad.
08x15,Unknown,Ted...
08x15,Unknown,And the backup pad.
08x15,Unknown,Narrator
08x15,Unknown,They were right.
08x15,Unknown,You can't force destiny.
08x15,Unknown,"If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen."
08x15,Unknown,(fire alarm ringing)
08x15,Unknown,"And funny story, kids..."
08x15,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
08x15,Unknown,It's you.
08x15,Unknown,...it happened.
08x15,Unknown,♪ How I Met Your Mother 8x15 ♪

08x15,Unknown,"Original Air Date on February 4, 2013"
08x15,Unknown,"Subway Girl's name is Jeanette, and she does grind her teeth."
08x15,Unknown,I assume that started the moment she met you?
08x15,Unknown,(laughing)
08x15,Unknown,"Uh, well, the fact is she wanted to find me."
08x15,Unknown,The first thing I did was list out all the details I remembered about you.
08x15,Unknown,Is... is that a yellow legal pad?
08x15,Unknown,Yeah.
08x15,Unknown,I've even got a backup.
08x15,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
08x15,Unknown,"You had a tweed blazer and chalk all over your hands, so I figured you were either a professor or a British gymnast."
08x15,(bad British accent),I'm bloody good on the pommel 'orse.
08x15,Unknown,Regrettin' this accent.
08x15,Unknown,Can't seem to stop.
08x15,Unknown,"So then I asked the lady at the student center where I could find the youngest, cutest professor on staff."
08x15,Unknown,And...?
08x15,Unknown,She sent me to a physics class.
08x15,Unknown,Professor Leyborne?
08x15,Unknown,I wonder if she'd think Dr. Goodhair was so cute if she knew he hasn't been published in over a year?
08x15,Unknown,"Then she sent me here, but the security guard wouldn't let me in without an ID."
08x15,Unknown,I was about to give up when the fire alarm just sent you out.
08x15,Unknown,It was like...
08x15,Unknown,Destiny.
08x15,Unknown,Right? Right?
08x15,Unknown,It's a meet-cute.
08x15,Unknown,It's a stalk-crazy.
08x15,Unknown,Look... there's a fine line between love and insanity.
08x15,Unknown,It's... the Dobler-Dahmer theory.
08x15,Unknown,"Oh, no..."
08x15,Unknown,(moans)
08x15,"Damn, I always forget the little one. TED",All right.
08x15,Unknown,"If both people are into each other, a big romantic gesture works."
08x15,Unknown,Like Lloyd Dobler holding up the boom box outside Diane Court's window in
08x15,Unknown,Say Anything.
08x15,Unknown,"But if one person isn't into the other, the same gesture comes off serial-k*ller crazy, or Dahmer."

08x15,Unknown,Dahmer.
08x15,Unknown,Whether a gesture's charming or alarming depends on how it's received.
08x15,Unknown,"And I was charmed by Jeanette finding me, hence... she's a Dobler."
08x15,Unknown,Don't you think it's a little convenient how that fire alarm happened to randomly go off?
08x15,Unknown,What are you saying?
08x15,Unknown,"Ted, does she have enormous cans?"
08x15,Unknown,No. Then what we're saying is she's a crazy stalker b*tch who pulled that fire alarm and you should run screaming.
08x15,Unknown,Robin
08x15,,You know what?
08x15,Unknown,"I-I don't think that we should be so cavalier with the word ""stalker."""
08x15,Unknown,Why does that word bother you so much?
08x15,Unknown,Doesn't bother me.
08x15,Unknown,Wait... do you have a stalker?
08x15,Unknown,I don't want to talk about this.
08x15,Unknown,Barney
08x15,,What do you mean?
08x15,Unknown,"As your fiancé, if you have some psycho stalker out there, I should know."
08x15,Unknown,It was me.
08x15,Unknown,I was a stalker.
08x15,Unknown,It was back in Canada.
08x15,Unknown,"I liked a guy and he didn't like me, and... well, I got a little obsessed."
08x15,Unknown,"I'd fill up my journals all about him, and eventually there may have been a teensy-weensy"
08x15,Unknown,50-meter restraining order.
08x15,Unknown,50 meters?
08x15,Unknown,(sighs)
08x15,Unknown,That's like... four years.
08x15,Unknown,Wow.
08x15,Unknown,You must have been a total nutbag.
08x15,Unknown,I wasn't.
08x15,Unknown,"Ted is right, there is a fine line."
08x15,Unknown,Anyone can cross it and get obsessed.
08x15,Unknown,"Yeah, if you're a total nutbag."
08x15,Unknown,(sighs)
08x15,Unknown,"Now, uh... who's the guy?"
08x15,Unknown,I'm not telling you until you admit that this can happen to anybody.
08x15,Unknown,I'm not admitting that.

08x15,Unknown,That fire alarm--
08x15,Unknown,did you pull it?
08x15,Unknown,Ugh...
08x15,Unknown,This is embarrassing.
08x15,Unknown,"I wasn't gonna tell you this, but..."
08x15,Unknown,"I'd come so far, only to be sent packing by that security guard, and... well..."
08x15,Unknown,(fire alarm ringing)
08x15,Unknown,I'm sorry.
08x15,Unknown,I just couldn't stand the idea of not meeting you.
08x15,Unknown,Ted
08x15,Unknown,Could not
08x15,Unknown,stand the idea of not meeting me.
08x15,Unknown,Was it a little over the top to pull that fire alarm? Perhaps.
08x15,Unknown,But it charmed me.
08x15,Unknown,Hence... Dobler.
08x15,Unknown,Aha! You see?
08x15,Unknown,People don't put fire alarms out in front lobbies for just anyone to prank pull.
08x15,Unknown,They put smoke detectors up on the ceiling.
08x15,Unknown,Hold on.
08x15,Unknown,I'm beginning to think that you guys didn't come here to see my new lectern.
08x15,Unknown,Are you implying Jeanette started a fire?
08x15,Unknown,Dahmer.
08x15,Unknown,Dobler.

08x15,Unknown,"Thanks again for the free donuts, eh?"
08x15,Unknown,"So, you up here visiting family?"
08x15,Unknown,No. I'm not Canadian.
08x15,Unknown,Not even a quarter Canadian on my father's side.
08x15,Unknown,Shut up.
08x15,Unknown,"We're not talking ""aboot"" me--"
08x15,Unknown,about
08x15,Unknown,me. Whoa.
08x15,Unknown,How long did you and Robin date?
08x15,Unknown,"Well, it wasn't really dating."
08x15,Unknown,We'd take a sixer of Labatts behind the hydro plant and she'd let me go under her parka over turtleneck.
08x15,Unknown,(laughs)
08x15,Unknown,Summer love.
08x15,Unknown,Was Robin obsessed with you?
08x15,Unknown,No.
08x15,(laughing),No.
08x15,Unknown,Robin was way more into this guy named...
08x15,Unknown,Turk Grimsby.
08x15,Unknown,I hear Robin was obsessed with you?
08x15,Unknown,"No. We only went out a few times, barely knew each other."
08x15,Unknown,"All we talked about was her relationship with her mother, the gnawing feelings of inadequacy, all the horrible secrets on that side of the family."
08x15,Unknown,"But heck, you're her fiancé."
08x15,Unknown,"You know all that, right?"
08x15,Unknown,Yeah.
08x15,Unknown,Robin was way more into this other guy.
08x15,Unknown,Can't seem to remember his name.
08x15,Unknown,Though sometimes a powdered jelly can help get the old noodle going.
08x15,Unknown,Ah...
08x15,Unknown,His name's...
08x15,Unknown,Simon Tremblay.
08x15,Unknown,I should have known.
08x15,Unknown,Eh.
08x15,Unknown,Thanks for the free donuts.
08x15,Unknown,They're just donuts!
08x15,Unknown,Okay? They're like two for a loonie--
08x15,Unknown,dollar.
08x15,Unknown,What's happening?
08x15,Unknown,"Oh, somebody moosed down all the jellies."
08x15,Unknown,Have you been hanging out with Turk Grimsby?
08x15,Unknown,So how serious were you and Robin?
08x15,Unknown,"Well, serious enough to pop the question."
08x15,Unknown,Wow. Really?
08x15,Unknown,"Yeah, sure."
08x15,Unknown,"Got down on one goalie pad, I said, ""Robin, could we keep dating but I get to stick it to other babes?"""
08x15,Unknown,Turned me down.
08x15,Unknown,I'm so sorry.
08x15,Unknown,"Oh, that's okay."
08x15,Unknown,I really wanted to stick it to Louise Marsh.
08x15,Unknown,(laughs)
08x15,Unknown,"Still, as the years pass, and you take stock of your life, part of me wishes I could've kept sticking it to Robin, too."
08x15,Unknown,So are you the one that Robin stalked?
08x15,Unknown,"Oh, that story goes back to the 1996 Grey Cup."
08x15,Unknown,What in God's name is that?
08x15,Unknown,Only Canada's Super Bowl.
08x15,Unknown,Didn't you ever see
08x15,Robin Sparkles,Underneath the Tunes
08x15,Unknown,on MuchMusic?
08x15,"Again, I have to go with",what in God's name is that?
08x15,Unknown,It's only Canada's VH1
08x15,Unknown,Behind the Music.
08x15,Unknown,There's one all about Robin Sparkles.
08x15,Unknown,"Tells you the whole story from ""A"" to zed."

08x15,Unknown,"Kids, relationships are built on trust."
08x15,Unknown,"So unlike Uncle Barney, I wasn't gonna keep digging and digging..."
08x15,Unknown,Did you start a fire?
08x15,Unknown,Ugh...
08x15,Unknown,This is embarrassing.
08x15,Unknown,"I wasn't gonna tell you this, but..."
08x15,Unknown,"I'd come so far, only to be sent packing by that security guard, and... well..."
08x15,Unknown,I'm sorry.
08x15,Unknown,I just couldn't stand the idea of not meeting you.
08x15,Unknown,Ted
08x15,Unknown,Could not
08x15,Unknown,stand the idea of not meeting me.
08x15,Unknown,"She set a fire, Ted!"
08x15,Unknown,Dahmer.
08x15,Unknown,You're just jealous 'cause Lily never burned anything for you.
08x15,Unknown,Clearly you never tried her pot roast.
08x15,Unknown,(rimshot)
08x15,Unknown,"I actually brought this for something totally different, but it worked out, right?"
08x15,Unknown,"Okay, anyway, here's my thing."
08x15,Unknown,(drumroll)
08x15,Unknown,"Ladies and gentlemen, I have in my back pocket the answer to the question ""Who was Robin obsessed with?"""

08x15,Unknown,"With her jelly bracelets, graffiti coat, and totally rad robot, no one symbolized the 1990s in Canada like Robin Sparkles."
08x15,Unknown,"But as we'd all learn one heartbreaking Grey Cup Sunday, Canada's sweetheart had a dark side."
08x15,Unknown,I'll never forget that moment.
08x15,Unknown,A little piece of Canada died that day.
08x15,Unknown,To see her throw her life away like that...
08x15,Unknown,...it was heartbreaking.
08x15,Unknown,I am so happy right now.

08x15,Unknown,Huge gig.
08x15,Unknown,"We're talking Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton,"
08x15,Unknown,just outside of Guelph.
08x15,Unknown,It doesn't get any bigger than that.
08x15,Unknown,(crowd cheering)
08x15,Unknown,"Hello, Canada. (giggles)"
08x15,Unknown,I'm Robin Sparkles.
08x15,Unknown,Oh. (blows kiss)
08x15,Unknown,(loud cheering)
08x15,Unknown,Actually...
08x15,Unknown,I was Robin Sparkles.
08x15,Unknown,The whole stadium went silent.
08x15,Unknown,"Right then, I knew something terrible was gonna happen."
08x15,Unknown,My stomach started churning.
08x15,Unknown,But Robin Sparkles is dead.
08x15,Unknown,All I could hear was Paul Shaffer's stomach growling.
08x15,Unknown,Stress goes to my stomach--
08x15,Unknown,sue me.
08x15,Unknown,It was kind of disgusting.
08x15,Unknown,"I'm sorry, Jason Priestley, I didn't realize you were the Queen of England."
08x15,Unknown,My new name is...
08x15,Unknown,Robin Daggers!
08x15,Unknown,"Two, three, four!"
08x15,Unknown,That day is now
08x15,Unknown,known in music history as the day grunge was born.
08x15,Unknown,"In 1996, in Canada?"
08x15,Unknown,"That seems right, Trebek."
08x15,Unknown,"Give him a break, he's not a music guy."
08x15,Unknown,That day is now known in music history as the day that grunge was born.
08x15,Unknown,"Well, that's a bummer."
08x15,Unknown,It was tragic.
08x15,Unknown,"I mean, to this day, you ask any Canadian where they were when Robin Sparkles lost it, not only can they tell you which Tim Hortons they were in, but what donut they were eating."
08x15,Unknown,"Me? Wawa, Ontario."
08x15,Unknown,Blueberry fritter.

08x15,Unknown,Should've been the best day of my life.
08x15,Unknown,It was horrifying on so many levels.
08x15,Unknown,"(stomach growling, sighs)"
08x15,Unknown,"Actually, you know what?"
08x15,Unknown,"I'm sorry, I can't..."

08x15,Unknown,Announcer
08x15,,Speculation began immediately.
08x15,Unknown,"Who was Robin Sparkles singing about with those angry, obsessive lyrics?"
08x15,Unknown,Many names were suggested.
08x15,Unknown,It wasn't me.
08x15,Unknown,It wasn't me.
08x15,Unknown,Wasn't me.
08x15,Unknown,It wasn't me.
08x15,Unknown,It wasn't me.
08x15,Unknown,It wasn't me.
08x15,Unknown,Why does everyone always think it's me?
08x15,Unknown,I wish it was me.
08x15,Unknown,Announcer
08x15,Unknown,But one name comes up more than any other.
08x15,Unknown,Alan Thicke.
08x15,Unknown,How can I help you?
08x15,Unknown,Donut?
08x15,Unknown,Whoa!
08x15,Unknown,(yells)
08x15,Unknown,Whoa. What happened to you?
08x15,Unknown,We watched
08x15,Robin Sparkles,Underneath the Tunes
08x15,Unknown,today.
08x15,Unknown,"Wait, what?"
08x15,Unknown,You guys get MuchMusic down here?
08x15,Unknown,And that video lead me to...
08x15,Unknown,"I am engaged to Robin Scherbatsky, and I know that she wrote ""P.S. I Love You"" for you."
08x15,Unknown,"Now-now, why is she so obsessed with you?"
08x15,Unknown,What? That song's not about me.
08x15,Unknown,"Then who is it ""aboot""-- about."
08x15,Unknown,Damn it.
08x15,Unknown,I don't know.
08x15,Unknown,I always thought it was Coulier.
08x15,Unknown,It wasn't me.
08x15,(laughs),Stop asking.
08x15,Unknown,"Geez, cut it out."
08x15,Unknown,I always liked that joke.
08x15,Unknown,Alan Thicke kicked your ass.
08x15,Unknown,"He lied, didn't he?"
08x15,Unknown,It was Alan Thicke!
08x15,Unknown,Wow.
08x15,Unknown,"It sounds like you've become a bit obsessed, huh, Barney?"
08x15,Unknown,I am not obsessed.
08x15,Unknown,"All I did was break into your apartment and read your teenage journals, and fly to Vancouver to interrogate your ex-boyfriends, and fight beloved Canadian actor Alan Thicke to a draw."
08x15,Unknown,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!"
08x15,Unknown,"So, ready to admit it?"
08x15,Unknown,(sighs)
08x15,Unknown,Anyone can get obsessed.
08x15,Unknown,Thank you.
08x15,Unknown,"And now, I am ready to tell you who ""P.S. I Love You"" is about."

08x15,Unknown,"""P.S."""
08x15,Unknown,Paul Shaffer.
08x15,Unknown,All
08x15,,Paul Shaffer?
08x15,Unknown,"I know, so stereotypical."
08x15,Unknown,Every young Canadian girl fantasizes about being with Paul Shaffer.
08x15,Unknown,"At the Grey Cup gig, Paul was sitting in the front row."
08x15,Unknown,♪ I'll always be waiting for you ♪
08x15,Unknown,No wonder his stomach was growling.
08x15,Unknown,I feel bad that I scared Paul.
08x15,Unknown,(sighs)
08x15,Unknown,He's amazing.
08x15,Unknown,But I have no regrets.
08x15,Unknown,I was done being Robin Sparkles.
08x15,Unknown,"You're not gonna go get beat up by Paul Shaffer now, are you?"
08x15,Unknown,I can't believe it.
08x15,Unknown,I'm a total Dahmer.
08x15,Unknown,"Yeah, but you're my Dahmer, which makes you a Dobler."
08x15,Unknown,Ted
08x15,,Just like Jeanette.
08x15,Unknown,"No, Ted, what that woman did to run in to you was bonkers."
08x15,Unknown,That's just not how you start a healthy relationship.
08x15,Unknown,"Tell him, Lil."
08x15,Unknown,I can't stand it anymore.
08x15,Unknown,I've been living a lie.
08x15,Unknown,See?
08x15,Unknown,Lily
08x15,Unknown,"I saw you at orientation and I needed an excuse to meet you, so..."
08x15,Unknown,(electrical crackling)
08x15,Unknown,Ah!

08x15,Unknown,(quiet laugh)
08x15,Unknown,Okay.
08x15,Unknown,"I'm sorry, I just couldn't stand the idea of not meeting you."
08x15,Unknown,Could... not stand the idea of not meeting me.
08x15,Unknown,"I'm sorry, Ted."
08x15,Unknown,You were right.
08x15,Unknown,Jeanette's a Dobler.
08x15,Unknown,So are you.
08x15,Unknown,"Thanks, buddy."
08x15,Unknown,"You know, if you hadn't been reading the exact same book as me, we never would've met."
08x15,Unknown,"I mean, that's destiny."
08x15,Unknown,"Oh, look."
08x15,Unknown,You bought it in the same bookstore I did.
08x15,Unknown,On the same day.
08x15,Unknown,Within ten minutes of me buying mine.
08x15,Unknown,Ugh...
08x15,Unknown,"Uh, this is embarrassing."
08x15,Unknown,"I wasn't gonna tell you this, but I followed you to that bookstore."
08x15,Unknown,I just couldn't stand the idea of not meeting you.
08x15,Unknown,You followed me to the bookstore from where?
08x15,Unknown,How long have you been following me?
08x15,Unknown,"Uh, this is embarrassing."
08x15,Unknown,"Uh, remember when you were on the cover of"

08x16,Unknown,"And at the time, I probably thought I meant it."
08x16,Unknown,"But, kids, I'll be honest."
08x16,Unknown,Being single's fun.
08x16,Unknown,"As a young unattached man in New York City, I had a great time."
08x16,Unknown,A great time.
08x16,Unknown,"What was I saying? Oh, yeah."
08x16,Unknown,I had such a great time that it took someone very special
08x16,Unknown,to make me want to settle down.
08x16,Unknown,And that someone... was Jeanette.
08x16,Unknown,What made Jeanette so special?
08x16,Unknown,Well...
08x16,Unknown,That was a foul!

08x16,Unknown,Agreed. Cray-cray gotta go bye-bye before you get s*ab-stabbed.
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, really?"
08x16,Unknown,"And are you guys saying this because you don't want me to be with Jeanette, or because you want me to stay single so you guys can keep your clubhouse?"
08x16,Unknown,J'accuse!
08x16,Unknown,Narrator
08x16,Unknown,"I had a point, and they knew it."
08x16,Unknown,"You see, in early 2013, I was the only single guy in the group."

08x16,Unknown,"You know what, Ted? That reminds me."

08x16,Unknown,"And P.S., if this disaster had been a superstorm instead of a hot lunatic, you'd all be begging to eat my freeze-dried protein paste and crap in my biohazard bucket. Just sayin'."
08x16,Unknown,I got it.
08x16,Unknown,It was on the floor of the bus.
08x16,Unknown,I should probably throw it out. Eh.
08x16,Unknown,Did he give you any problems?
08x16,Unknown,"He cried a little, but then he stopped."
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, good. Anything else happen?"
08x16,Unknown,Nope.
08x16,Unknown,That... is... it.
08x16,Unknown,All gone!
08x16,Unknown,We have to do this more often.
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, we totally do."
08x16,Unknown,I can't believe Marvin's in kindergarten.
08x16,Unknown,He's growing up so fast.
08x16,Unknown,Can I confess something to you?
08x16,Unknown,Remember the day you left Marvin's binky on the bus and you left me alone with him? Yeah.
08x16,Unknown,"Well, I didn't tell you this at the time, but..."
08x16,Unknown,(Marvin crying)
08x16,Unknown,"Okay, okay. Yeah, there, there, there."
08x16,Unknown,"Okay, shh, shh."
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, no, it looks like somebody's not happy."
08x16,Unknown,No kidding. I'm miserable.
08x16,Unknown,Listen to this thing.
08x16,Unknown,He probably just wants to be held.
08x16,Unknown,I think you're right.
08x16,Unknown,Can you do it?
08x16,Unknown,All right.
08x16,Unknown,"Come here, handsome. Oh. Yeah."
08x16,Unknown,(crying stops)
08x16,Unknown,Yes.
08x16,Unknown,Oh.
08x16,Unknown,I let a stranger pick up Marvin. I'm sorry.
08x16,Unknown,"It's just, I hadn't actually picked him up at that point, and I was scared, so..."
08x16,Unknown,You know what? It was four years ago.
08x16,Unknown,He's obviously fine. Don't even worry about it.
08x16,Unknown,Really? Yeah.
08x16,Unknown,Thank you.
08x16,Unknown,"I mean, as long as there's not more to that story."
08x16,Unknown,Nope. That... is... it.
08x16,Unknown,"Jeanette, you have to leave!"
08x16,Unknown,JEANETTE
08x16,,In a minute!
08x16,Unknown,I still haven't found that book!
08x16,Unknown,(loud crashing)
08x16,Unknown,"Listen, Jeanette, I didn't want to do this, but I called the police. They're on their way."
08x16,WOMAN (over radio),"All units, all units."
08x16,Unknown,"Possible 10-90 in progress at 521 West 82nd, apartment 15."
08x16,Unknown,Where's that coming from?
08x16,Unknown,"Is that you, Dolores?"
08x16,Unknown,"Jeanette? Hey, girl. How you been?"
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, you know, I'm just doing me."
08x16,Unknown,"Anyway, I'll check out that 10-90."
08x16,Unknown,"Okay, but remember..."
08x16,Unknown,"I know, no excessive force."
08x16,Unknown,"Last thing I need is another suspension, am I right? (laughs)"
08x16,Unknown,Narrator
08x16,Unknown,"And that, kids, was how I found out"
08x16,Unknown,what Jeanette did for a living.
08x16,Unknown,Wait a second.
08x16,(Boston accent),Is she a cop?!
08x16,(Boston accent),I think she's a cop!
08x16,Unknown,Did you know she was a cop?!
08x16,Unknown,I didn't know she was a
08x16,Unknown,cop!
08x16,Unknown,"Ted, I'm sorry I have to say this-- Jeanette lives here now."
08x16,Unknown,This is her place. You're gonna have to leave.
08x16,Unknown,What?
08x16,Unknown,Why don't you have to leave?
08x16,Unknown,JEANETTE
08x16,,They can stay.
08x16,Unknown,"Thank you, Officer Jeanette. Thank you, Officer Jeanette."
08x16,Unknown,All gone. (giggles)
08x16,Unknown,We need to do this more often.
08x16,Unknown,We totally do. I can't believe Marvin's in middle school.
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, he's growing up so fast."
08x16,Unknown,Can I confess something to you?
08x16,Unknown,Remember that day you left Marvin's binky on the bus and I let that old lady pick him up?
08x16,Unknown,I seem to recall that was the entire story.
08x16,Unknown,There's a little bit more.
08x16,Unknown,"There, there, little one."
08x16,Unknown,"Let's put you back in your strolly-poo, so you can drift off to dreamy-dreamy land."
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, thank you so much."
08x16,Unknown,"Yeah, this is my first time alone with him, and, you know, um, I have this weird feeling that I'm gonna, I don't know, like, drop him or injure him in some way, which is completely insane."
08x16,Unknown,But... (laughs)
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, heavens."
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, my God!"
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
08x16,Unknown,"I know, I'm so sorry."
08x16,Unknown,"Well, you know what?"
08x16,Unknown,"That was what, 12 years ago?"
08x16,Unknown,Don't even worry about it.
08x16,Unknown,Really? Yeah.
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, thank you."
08x16,Unknown,Just promise me there's no more to that story.
08x16,Unknown,"Nope, that is it."
08x16,Unknown,Are you sure you want to do this?
08x16,Unknown,The girl's a cop.
08x16,Unknown,"Yeah, this seems like a really bad idea."
08x16,Unknown,I don't care.
08x16,Unknown,I am going into that bedroom because this is my home and I have to defend it.
08x16,Unknown,But mostly because my allergy medication is in there!
08x16,Unknown,"All right, just be careful, okay?"
08x16,Unknown,This girl is really crazy.
08x16,Unknown,"Yeah, why can't she just accept the fact that you guys broke up?"
08x16,Unknown,"I know, I know, why can't she just accept that?"
08x16,Unknown,"Why, it's, like, why?"
08x16,Unknown,(dramatic music plays)
08x16,Unknown,It might be because we didn't actually break up.
08x16,Unknown,"(record scratches, music stops)"
08x16,Unknown,"Aw, man."
08x16,Unknown,"Jeanette, come on, that's vintage vinyl."
08x16,Unknown,"Ted, did you or didn't you break up with Jeanette last night?"
08x16,Unknown,"I don't know, it's kind of confusing."
08x16,Unknown,I think we need to talk.
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, oh, okay."
08x16,Unknown,I see where this is going.
08x16,Unknown,You're in love with Lily.
08x16,Unknown,"That's it, isn't it?"
08x16,Unknown,"What? No, I..."
08x16,Unknown,Like I should be surprised with her fancy medical degree and her sexy Southern drawl.
08x16,Unknown,What? She's not...
08x16,Unknown,"Don't talk to me, don't look at me."
08x16,Unknown,I hate you and I never want to see you again!
08x16,Unknown,And then things got crazy and we got thrown out of the Barclays Center.
08x16,Unknown,"I don't know, it felt pretty breakup-y."
08x16,Unknown,"Mm. Anyway, we parted on pretty bad terms, so..."
08x16,Unknown,I kind of thought maybe I could...
08x16,Unknown,Never contact her again and hope she'd take the hint and just leave you alone?
08x16,Unknown,"Barney, give me some credit."
08x16,Unknown,Was that the plan? Yes.
08x16,Unknown,All gone. We need to do this more often.
08x16,Unknown,We totally do.
08x16,Unknown,I can't believe Marvin's in high school.
08x16,Unknown,He's growing up so fast.
08x16,Unknown,"Can I confess something to you? Oh, no. What?"
08x16,Unknown,What happened?
08x16,Unknown,Tell me what you did to my son.
08x16,Unknown,This is not going well at all.
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, honey, you are shaking."
08x16,Unknown,Let's get you out of the cold.
08x16,Unknown,What's open near here?
08x16,Unknown,♪
08x16,Unknown,You took my infant child to a strip club?
08x16,Unknown,It was just topless.
08x16,Unknown,He saw yours all the time anyway.
08x16,Unknown,"Okay, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that, but that is all there is."
08x16,Unknown,"Okay, there is no more to the story."
08x16,Unknown,I have now told you everything.
08x16,Unknown,Robin
08x16,Unknown,All gone.
08x16,Unknown,We need to do this more often. We totally do.
08x16,Unknown,I can't believe Marvin's driving.
08x16,Unknown,He's growing up so fast.
08x16,Unknown,"Okay, there's one other thing."
08x16,Unknown,What?
08x16,Unknown,"Well, I have to go use the ladies' room."
08x16,Unknown,Can you watch him for me?
08x16,Unknown,Of course.
08x16,Unknown,I could just eat you up.
08x16,Unknown,(laughs)
08x16,Unknown,You left him with a complete stranger?
08x16,Unknown,He could've been...
08x16,Unknown,"Robin, how could you? Lily, please, okay, it was 16 years ago."
08x16,Unknown,He's fine.
08x16,Unknown,You're right.
08x16,Unknown,It's fine.
08x16,Unknown,(sighs)
08x16,Unknown,"God, it feels so good to have gotten this off my chest."
08x16,Unknown,Finally it is all on the table.
08x16,Unknown,All secrets are exposed and there is nothing left to be revealed.
08x16,Unknown,All gone. We need to do this more...
08x16,Unknown,"There's more to the story. Damn it, Robin."
08x16,Unknown,What could you possibly have left out?
08x16,Unknown,"It's just there's, um, one little detail that I may have slightly altered."
08x16,Unknown,"If he starts crying, just pick him up."
08x16,Unknown,(Marvin crying)
08x16,Unknown,"Yeah, there, there."
08x16,Unknown,"Come on, buddy, shh."
08x16,Unknown,Looks like somebody's unhappy.
08x16,Unknown,"No kidding, I'm miserable."
08x16,Unknown,Listen to this thing.
08x16,Unknown,Maybe he needs to be held.
08x16,Unknown,I think you're right.
08x16,Unknown,Can you do it?
08x16,Unknown,Sure.
08x16,Unknown,"Come here, handsome."
08x16,Unknown,"Come here, come here, you handsome devil, you."
08x16,Unknown,(crying stops)
08x16,Unknown,You're such a beautiful...
08x16,Unknown,"Aw, you're such a cool dude."
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, look at you, oh."
08x16,Unknown,"All right, there, there, little one, there, there."
08x16,Unknown,Let me put you back in your strolly-poo so you can drift off to dreamy-dreamy land.
08x16,Unknown,Okay? All right.
08x16,Unknown,Thank you so much.
08x16,Unknown,"Hey, don't worry about it."
08x16,Unknown,"It's my first time alone with him, and I just have this weird feeling I'm gonna drop him or injure him in some way."
08x16,Unknown,I know it's completely insane...
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, heavens, oh, watch it, no!"
08x16,(screams),No!
08x16,Unknown,This is not going well at all.
08x16,Unknown,(sighs)
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, hon, you're shaking."
08x16,Unknown,Let's get out of the cold.
08x16,Unknown,Is there anything open near here?
08x16,Unknown,(sighs)
08x16,Unknown,♪
08x16,Unknown,"Hey, I need to go to the ladies' room-- can you watch him for me?"
08x16,Unknown,Of course. I could just eat you up.
08x16,Unknown,"Look at you, yum, yum, yum, yum."
08x16,Unknown,You waited 17 years to tell me that you met the greatest boxer of all time?
08x16,Unknown,My son was rocked to sleep by Senator Mike Tyson?
08x16,Unknown,"I wanted to tell you, believe me. How could you...?"
08x16,Unknown,"Okay, this is the right thing to do."
08x16,Unknown,You got to go up there and break up with her for real.
08x16,Unknown,"And don't worry, if anything happens, just scream, we'll come rescue you."
08x16,Unknown,Okay.
08x16,Unknown,(laughs)
08x16,Unknown,Did you guys not hear me screaming up there?
08x16,Unknown,"Aw, I feel so awful."
08x16,Unknown,We went to get subs.
08x16,Unknown,We got you one though.
08x16,Unknown,We didn't get you one.
08x16,Unknown,"So, Jeanette's squatting in your room?"
08x16,Unknown,What are you guys doing here?
08x16,Unknown,We heard you screaming from three blocks away.
08x16,Unknown,Why is she in there?
08x16,Unknown,"Lily, there is no reason why."
08x16,Unknown,That's like asking why is the earth round?
08x16,Unknown,Why does the sun come up in the morning?
08x16,Unknown,What do I do for a living?
08x16,Unknown,There are some questions we're not meant to know the answer to.
08x16,Unknown,Crazy girls are crazy because they're crazy.
08x16,Unknown,I-I don't think it's quite that simple.
08x16,Unknown,I was talking to a friend of mine about Ted and Jeanette.
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, great, what friend is this?"
08x16,Unknown,"Uh, just this wise old lady that I know."
08x16,Unknown,Here's the thing about crazy.
08x16,Unknown,"When a guy sends mixed signals to a girl, it takes a toll on her psychological well-being."
08x16,Unknown,"You want to know why a girl acts crazy, look at the guy she's dating."
08x16,Unknown,Then you really see some crazy.
08x16,Unknown,Trust me.
08x16,Unknown,Are you Mike Tyson?
08x16,Unknown,"Now, hold on."
08x16,Unknown,"I've dated tons of crazy girls in my life, and not once have I ever treated them with anything other than..."
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, right, I'm a monster."
08x16,Unknown,Maybe the old lady with the face tattoo is right.
08x16,Unknown,Maybe the reason Jeanette's acting this way is Ted.
08x16,Unknown,Me? How is this my fault?
08x16,Unknown,"Yeah, come on, this is Ted we're talking about."
08x16,Unknown,"I'm sure he didn't do anything to lead her on or send mixed signals, right, Ted?"
08x16,Unknown,"Don't talk to me, don't look at me."
08x16,Unknown,I hate you and I never want to see you again!
08x16,Unknown,And we got thrown out of the Barclays Center.
08x16,Unknown,"Okay, that's disappointing."
08x16,Unknown,So disappointing.
08x16,Unknown,Seriously.
08x16,Unknown,"But that was last night. I mean, it's not like..."
08x16,Unknown,"Listen, Jeanette, we really need to have a serious talk about our..."
08x16,Unknown,"So, did Lily leave these boots here or was it some other b*tch?"
08x16,Unknown,"Marshall, Barney, help me!"
08x16,Unknown,I don't think they're coming.
08x16,Unknown,I guess not.
08x16,Unknown,It's those red boots.
08x16,Unknown,They just look sexy on everyone.
08x16,Unknown,"Okay, Ted, what is with the red boots?"
08x16,Unknown,"You're a smart guy, you've got some taste, you got a visual sense, I mean, you're an architect for Pete's sakes."
08x16,Unknown,How can you look at those boots and think...
08x16,Unknown,"Oh, my God, I'm holding it, I'm holding the baby."
08x16,Unknown,"What, you've never held him before?"
08x16,Unknown,"Uh, tons of times."
08x16,Unknown,This-this is not a big moment for me.
08x16,(quietly),This is exhilarating.
08x16,Unknown,(crashing upstairs)
08x16,Unknown,"Look, yes, I know what you're gonna say."
08x16,Unknown,"I have to break up with her. No, I was actually gonna say the opposite."
08x16,Unknown,I think you need to be with Jeanette right now.
08x16,Unknown,Because she's the one.
08x16,Unknown,No. What? No.
08x16,Unknown,She's insane.
08x16,Unknown,But I think you are also a little insane right now.
08x16,Unknown,"So I think you need to go be with your crazy girl for a while and when it all goes down in flames-- and I don't mean that figuratively, I expect there to be actual flames..."
08x16,Unknown,Narrator
08x16,Unknown,And there were.
08x16,Unknown,...we'll be here for you because we love you.
08x16,Unknown,"Jeanette I just want to say that, uh, you going through my stuff like that..."
08x16,Unknown,You are really something special.
08x16,Unknown,I'm gonna send Lily a dead animal in the mail.
08x16,Unknown,I think I'm falling for you.
08x16,Unknown,I think we should have a three-way with my therapist.
08x16,Unknown,He's 70.
08x16,Unknown,What is your ring size?
08x16,(whispers),Robin.
08x16,It's 3,00 in the morning.
08x16,(whispers),Really?
08x16,Unknown,"Yeah, you sure you don't want to just put him in the crib and, you know, go home?"
08x16,Unknown,"No, I'm good."
08x16,Unknown,Okay.
08x16,Unknown,Good night.
08x16,Unknown,Good night.
08x16,Unknown,What's that smell?
08x16,(whispers),Lily! Lily!
08x17,Unknown,Thanks.
08x17,Unknown,That's weird. I have a message.
08x17,Unknown,That's weird.
08x17,Unknown,You still have an answering machine.
08x17,Unknown,(beep)
08x17,Unknown,"Ted, this is the Captain."
08x17,Unknown,Please call me back at your earliest convenience.
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, crap."
08x17,Unknown,♪ How I Met Your Mother 8x17 ♪
08x17,Unknown,The Ashtray
08x17,Unknown,"Original Air Date on February 18, 2013"
08x17,Unknown,Narrator
08x17,,"Kids, you remember the Captain."
08x17,Unknown,"He was one of the richest men in New York, and when I met him, he was married to Zoey,"
08x17,Unknown,who I ended up... befriending.
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, man, he seems pissed. Does he?"
08x17,Unknown,Yes. Listen.
08x17,Unknown,(beep)
08x17,Unknown,"Ted, this is the Captain."
08x17,Unknown,Please call me back at your earliest convenience.
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, I hear it now."
08x17,Unknown,What? I don't know.
08x17,Unknown,Listen again.
08x17,Unknown,(beep)
08x17,Unknown,"Ted, this is the Captain."
08x17,Unknown,Please call me back at your earliest convenience.
08x17,Unknown,Marshall
08x17,Unknown,He sounds pissed.
08x17,Unknown,"Yeah, and I think I know why."
08x17,Unknown,It has to do with the last time I saw him.
08x17,Unknown,"It was, um... it was, like, a year and a half ago."
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, boy, that was a crazy story."
08x17,(chuckling),"Oh, boy, yeah."
08x17,Unknown,I remember.
08x17,Unknown,You weren't there.
08x17,Unknown,"Ted,"
08x17,Unknown,bubbeleh.
08x17,Unknown,"If you have a crazy story, I was there."
08x17,Unknown,That's just a law of the universe.
08x17,Unknown,So what happened?
08x17,Unknown,"Well, it was a few weeks after Zoey and I broke up, and I was on the rebound, and I kind of rekindled things with that girl, Becky."
08x17,Unknown,"Becky? Boats, boats, boats."
08x17,Unknown,"Boats, boats, boats!"
08x17,Unknown,Boats!
08x17,Unknown,What's this a commercial for again?
08x17,Unknown,I can't quite...
08x17,Unknown,"Boats, boats, boats!"
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, get a room, you two."
08x17,Unknown,Ted
08x17,Unknown,You weren't there.
08x17,Unknown,"I was, too."
08x17,Unknown,"All right, you were there? Tell me the story."
08x17,Unknown,I like the way you tell it.
08x17,Unknown,"Please, I insist."
08x17,Unknown,"Okay, we'll tell it together."
08x17,Unknown,Okay.
08x17,Unknown,Lily... Lily... had invited us...
08x17,Unknown,...had invited us...
08x17,Unknown,...to an art...
08x17,Unknown,...Garfunkel concert.
08x17,Unknown,...gallery opening.
08x17,Unknown,An Art Garfunkel gallery opening concert.
08x17,Unknown,"Go on, Ted. You're doing great."
08x17,Unknown,"Anyway, I get to the gallery..."
08x17,Unknown,This place is so fancy.
08x17,Unknown,I hope I don't embarrass myself.
08x17,Unknown,"What? Lily, come on."
08x17,Unknown,You got nothing to be embarrassed about.
08x17,Unknown,"Dude, look who it is."
08x17,Unknown,And who should walk in but...
08x17,Unknown,Daddy's home.
08x17,Unknown,Nope.
08x17,Unknown,"Well, well, Ted Mosby, my old nemesis."
08x17,Unknown,What are you doing here?
08x17,Unknown,"Um, well, uh, Lily saw an ad for this..."
08x17,Unknown,Gallery?
08x17,Unknown,So we... we came to check out the...
08x17,Unknown,Artwork.
08x17,Unknown,And then we ran into...
08x17,Unknown,Me.
08x17,Unknown,Ted
08x17,Unknown,"Man, this guy's so rude."
08x17,Unknown,"I mean, I get why he's mad."
08x17,Unknown,I did stick it to his ex-wife... repeatedly.
08x17,Unknown,"Still, he's being a jerk."
08x17,Unknown,Someone needs to bring him down a peg.
08x17,Unknown,I'm sorry. Where are my...
08x17,Unknown,Manners.
08x17,Unknown,That's how that feels.
08x17,Unknown,This is my art consultant.
08x17,Unknown,Shelly.
08x17,Unknown,Art consultant? What's that?
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, Shelly helps the Captain select artwork based on its aesthetic appeal and value as an investment."
08x17,Unknown,That's why I think she's gonna love this elephant painting.
08x17,Unknown,I think this artist is going places.
08x17,Unknown,"Well, I should go."
08x17,Unknown,"Captain, we'll talk tomorrow?"
08x17,Unknown,At ease.
08x17,Unknown,"Hey, if you like art, you should see the painting I just acquired."
08x17,Unknown,It's in my apartment just upstairs.
08x17,Unknown,It's gonna blow you away.
08x17,Unknown,Anyone with this kind of ashtray money probably has an island where he hunts people.
08x17,Unknown,Probably somewhere in the Caribbean.
08x17,Unknown,I bet there's good snorkeling.
08x17,Unknown,"Hello, my darling, my one true love, my everything."
08x17,Unknown,"So, who wants to see that painting?"
08x17,Unknown,"Okay, Captain, we know why you brought us up here. It's, uh... it's about me and Zoey."
08x17,Unknown,"Ted, if you've got something to say, say it."
08x17,Unknown,A harpoon g*n?
08x17,Unknown,A double-barreled harpoon g*n.
08x17,Unknown,One barrel.
08x17,Unknown,With a scope.
08x17,Unknown,No scope.
08x17,Unknown,"I know you're upset, Captain, but I promise you nothing happened between me and Zoey until after you guys split up, okay?"
08x17,Unknown,So let's...
08x17,Unknown,"Let's please, just-just-just put this down."
08x17,Unknown,"Okay? Okay, oh, there we go."
08x17,Unknown,"Look, Ted, I'm not mad at you."
08x17,Unknown,"The truth is I'm in love with somebody else now, so we're fine."
08x17,Unknown,"Just don't steal this one from me, too, okay?"
08x17,Unknown,Okay?
08x17,Unknown,(laughter)
08x17,Unknown,Of course.
08x17,Unknown,I promise. Okay.
08x17,Unknown,But that got me thinking.
08x17,Unknown,Who was this new lady in his life?
08x17,Unknown,I-I had this weird sinking feeling.
08x17,Unknown,We both did.
08x17,Unknown,I had to see that picture.
08x17,Unknown,So I waited until everyone
08x17,Unknown,"was out of the room, and then..."
08x17,Unknown,BECKY
08x17,Unknown,"Boats, boats, boats!"
08x17,Unknown,No.
08x17,Unknown,No...!
08x17,Unknown,"She's ""boats, boats, boats,"" and he's the Captain."
08x17,Unknown,That's sweet; I'm happy for those two.
08x17,Unknown,"Ted, you suck."
08x17,Unknown,(phone rings)
08x17,Unknown,(gasps)
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, my God, oh, my God."
08x17,Unknown,"It's him, it's him. What do I do?"
08x17,Unknown,"What do I do? Ted, wait a second."
08x17,Unknown,What do I do? Wait a second. Wait a second!
08x17,Unknown,"Hey, is there any chance that he is calling to invite the three of us out on his boat?"
08x17,Unknown,"Uh, I don't know, maybe like one percent."
08x17,Unknown,Ted's phone. Hold for Ted.
08x17,Unknown,Hello.
08x17,Unknown,"Ted, I'm gonna ask you something, and I want you to be completely honest."
08x17,Unknown,What's your friend Robin's number?
08x17,Unknown,What?
08x17,Unknown,"Ted, ask about the boat."
08x17,Unknown,"Uh, Captain, can... can I put you on hold?"
08x17,Unknown,Affirmative.
08x17,Unknown,He wants Robin's number.
08x17,Unknown,Should I give it to him?
08x17,Unknown,Is he trying to hook up with my fiancée?
08x17,Unknown,"No, uh-uh. (snorts)"
08x17,Unknown,"The only way that's happening is if I get to hook up with someone, too."
08x17,Unknown,Wait a second... No.
08x17,Unknown,Unless... Absolutely not.
08x17,Unknown,However... Forget it.
08x17,Unknown,On the other hand... Ixnay!
08x17,Unknown,"Guys, guys, I got to make a decision here."
08x17,Unknown,"Okay, you know what, I say do it."
08x17,Unknown,"If it is a booty call, then Robin will just let him down easy, but in the meantime, Ted is back on the Captain's good side."
08x17,Unknown,We all get to go out on his boat; I get to steer it.
08x17,Unknown,Everybody wins.
08x17,Unknown,Okay.
08x17,Unknown,Fine. Give him her number.
08x17,Unknown,You don't think she'll mind?
08x17,Unknown,I don't think she'll mind.
08x17,Unknown,You gave the Captain my number?
08x17,Unknown,She minds.
08x17,Unknown,Do you not remember that night we hung out with him at the art show?
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, right, of course you don't remember because, earlier that night, you shared a big, fat sandwich with Becky."
08x17,Unknown,"Boats, boats, boats!"
08x17,Unknown,What's this a commercial for again?
08x17,Unknown,"Yeah, so?"
08x17,Unknown,I hardly think that changes the story.
08x17,Unknown,Mmm. Mmm.
08x17,Unknown,Delicious!
08x17,Unknown,This place is so fancy.
08x17,Unknown,I hope I don't embarrass myself.
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, come on, Lily."
08x17,Unknown,You got nothing to be embarrassed about.
08x17,Unknown,"Dude, look who's here."
08x17,Unknown,Daddy's home.
08x17,Unknown,Nope. Nope.
08x17,Unknown,"Well, well."
08x17,Unknown,(screams)
08x17,Unknown,"Ted Mosby, my old nemesis."
08x17,Unknown,What are you doing here?
08x17,Unknown,"Well, Lily... saw an ad for this..."
08x17,Unknown,Gallery.
08x17,Unknown,"So we thought we'd, um... come and check out the..."
08x17,Unknown,Artwork?
08x17,Unknown,And then we ran into...
08x17,Unknown,Me?
08x17,Unknown,Robin
08x17,Unknown,And the Captain wasn't glaring at you.
08x17,Unknown,He couldn't take his eyes off...
08x17,Unknown,"Hey, nice to see you again."
08x17,Unknown,"Yeah, you, too."
08x17,Unknown,Oh.
08x17,Unknown,"Man, this guy is so rude."
08x17,Unknown,"I mean, I get why he's upset."
08x17,Unknown,I did stick it to his ex-wife... repeatedly.
08x17,Unknown,"Still, the guy's being a jerk."
08x17,Unknown,Someone needs to take him down a peg.
08x17,Unknown,(clears throat)
08x17,Unknown,Sorry.
08x17,Unknown,Where are my manners?
08x17,Unknown,"This is Shelly, my art consultant."
08x17,Unknown,Art consultant? What's that?
08x17,Unknown,Shelly helps the Captain select artwork based on aesthetic...
08x17,Unknown,Manners!
08x17,Unknown,That's how that feels.
08x17,Unknown,"...appeal and value as an investment, and that's why I think she's gonna love this elephant painting."
08x17,Unknown,I think this artist is going places.
08x17,Unknown,"Well, I should go."
08x17,Unknown,"Captain, we'll talk tomorrow."
08x17,Unknown,"If you like art, you should see the painting I just acquired."
08x17,Unknown,It's gonna blow you away.
08x17,Unknown,Snorkeling.
08x17,Unknown,Robin
08x17,Unknown,"Then, after I saved you from destroying"
08x17,Unknown,a priceless crystal ashtray...
08x17,Unknown,You're welcome.
08x17,Unknown,(screams)
08x17,Unknown,"Hello, my darling, my one true love, my everything."
08x17,Unknown,Ahoy?
08x17,Unknown,So who wants to see that painting?
08x17,Unknown,"Okay, Captain."
08x17,Unknown,We all know why you brought us up here.
08x17,Unknown,"This is about me and, um..."
08x17,Unknown,(snaps fingers)
08x17,Unknown,Zoey.
08x17,Unknown,"All right, Ted."
08x17,Unknown,"If you've got something to say, say it."
08x17,Unknown,"Whoa, whoa."
08x17,Unknown,A remote control?
08x17,Unknown,A remote control.
08x17,Unknown,Let's relax.
08x17,Unknown,"I-I know you're upset, Captain."
08x17,Unknown,I-I just... I want to assure you nothing happened between me and Zoey until after you guys had split up.
08x17,Unknown,So let's just... let's just... let's put this down.
08x17,Unknown,"Okay, okay."
08x17,Unknown,There we go.
08x17,Unknown,"Ted, I'm not mad at you."
08x17,Unknown,"Truth is, I'm in love with somebody else now."
08x17,Unknown,"So he invited me back to his bedroom to show me this painting, and..."
08x17,Unknown,Finally.
08x17,Unknown,We're alone.
08x17,Unknown,Barney
08x17,Unknown,"Robin, no, I don't want"
08x17,Unknown,to picture that. Nothing happened.
08x17,Unknown,"Aw, that means hand stuff. What?"
08x17,Unknown,No.
08x17,Unknown,I'm serious--
08x17,Unknown,he was on the rebound.
08x17,Unknown,I told him to take some time to pull himself together and... call me in a year and a half.
08x17,Unknown,Barney
08x17,,"Ah, great."
08x17,Unknown,What if he asks you out?
08x17,Unknown,What does that mean for our relationship?
08x17,Unknown,"What, are we planning to be in some super-enlightened, forward-thinking marriage, where we don't get hung up on the suffocating and outdated principles of monogamy, and instead enjoy the company of multiple partners, sometimes bringing said partners into our marital bed, but just girls, not dudes, except maybe one time just to see what that's like?"
08x17,Unknown,"I mean, is that what you want?"
08x17,Unknown,No.
08x17,Unknown,Okay.
08x17,Unknown,"Me, neither!"
08x17,Unknown,"Okay, Robin, look, you-you need to call the Captain and let him down easy, okay?"
08x17,Unknown,Let him move on with his life.
08x17,Unknown,"Let him go out on his boat with his old friends, maybe some new friends."
08x17,Unknown,Maybe let one of those new friends steer the boat.
08x17,Unknown,"Just so that one of them could say, ""Iceberg straighthead!"""
08x17,Unknown,Fine.
08x17,Unknown,(sighs)
08x17,Unknown,Ahoy.
08x17,Unknown,"Hi. Captain, it's Robin."
08x17,Unknown,Ahoy.
08x17,Unknown,"Uh, look, I, uh, have to be upfront with you."
08x17,Unknown,I'm engaged.
08x17,Unknown,Engaged? I thought you were married to Marshall.
08x17,Unknown,This is Robin right?
08x17,Unknown,The redheaded kindergarten teacher who wore the gray dress and the blue shoes to that art show?
08x17,Unknown,Can you please hold a moment?
08x17,Unknown,Dropping anchor.
08x17,Unknown,He's looking for Lily.
08x17,Unknown,Should I give him her number?
08x17,Unknown,Yeah. We've already discussed it.
08x17,Unknown,It's $4 million cash.
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, her phone number."
08x17,Unknown,"Yes, I don't think she'll mind."
08x17,Unknown,You gave the Captain my number?
08x17,Unknown,She minds.
08x17,Unknown,(sighs)
08x17,Unknown,It finally happened.
08x17,Unknown,My past finally caught up with me.
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, God."
08x17,Unknown,"Lily, if you tell me that you slept with the Captain for anything under 2.8, which we agreed was as low as we were going to go..."
08x17,Unknown,"No, it's nothing like that."
08x17,Unknown,Do you guys remember the last time we saw the Captain?
08x17,Unknown,All
08x17,,"Yes. LILY: Oh, right."
08x17,Unknown,"Of course you don't. Barney, you weren't there."
08x17,Unknown,"Ted, you had just floated out of a Snoop Dogg B-side."
08x17,Unknown,"And, Robin, you had just come from that big meeting that ran long."
08x17,Unknown,(whooping)
08x17,Unknown,(imitating drums)
08x17,Unknown,Delicious. Shrimpy for me.
08x17,Unknown,This place is so fancy.
08x17,Unknown,I hope I don't embarrass myself.
08x17,Unknown,"Come on, Lily, you have nothing to be embarrassed about."
08x17,Unknown,Dude!
08x17,Unknown,Look who's here!
08x17,Unknown,Daddy's...
08x17,Unknown,Nope. Nope.
08x17,Unknown,"Well, well."
08x17,Unknown,(Ted shrieking)
08x17,Unknown,"Ted Mosby, my old nemesis."
08x17,Unknown,"Hello, sailor."
08x17,Unknown,Robin
08x17,Unknown,No!
08x17,Unknown,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
08x17,Unknown,"Okay, yeah, that's what happened."
08x17,Unknown,"This is Shelly, my art consultant."
08x17,Unknown,(scoffs)
08x17,Unknown,Art consultant!
08x17,Unknown,What's that?
08x17,Unknown,"Shelly helps the Captain select artwork based on its aesthetic appeal and its value as an investment, which is why I think she's gonna love this elephant painting."
08x17,Unknown,I think this artist is going places.
08x17,Unknown,You'd have to be a real Dumbo not to enjoy this painting.
08x17,Unknown,(laughs) Get it? 'Cause he's an elephant?
08x17,Unknown,Your sense of humor is as good as your taste in art.
08x17,Unknown,Captain?
08x17,Unknown,We'll talk tomorrow?
08x17,Unknown,"If you like art, you should see the painting I just acquired."
08x17,Unknown,It's in my...
08x17,Unknown,Manners.
08x17,Unknown,That's how that feels.
08x17,Unknown,In my apartment right upstairs.
08x17,Unknown,It's gonna blow you away.
08x17,Unknown,Snorkeling.
08x17,Unknown,Lily
08x17,Unknown,"Then, after I saved you from destroying"
08x17,Unknown,a priceless crystal ashtray...
08x17,Unknown,You're welcome.
08x17,Unknown,(shrieks)
08x17,Unknown,"Hello, my darling, my one true love, my everything."
08x17,Unknown,"So, who wants to see that painting?"
08x17,Unknown,"Ooh, if you show me yours, I'll show you mine."
08x17,Unknown,So we check out the painting.
08x17,Unknown,"Huh. You know, that elephant painting would look nice in here."
08x17,Unknown,"You're looking at a masterpiece, and you're talking about some elephant painting?"
08x17,TED (yelling),No...!
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, this one's nice, too."
08x17,Unknown,I just like the elephant painting better.
08x17,Unknown,"You know, it doesn't matter what you like."
08x17,Unknown,You're just a kindergarten teacher.
08x17,Unknown,"Ah, finally we're alone."
08x17,Unknown,(giggles)
08x17,Unknown,(snoring)
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, no, Lily, what did you do?"
08x17,Unknown,He was a jerk--
08x17,Unknown,he deserved to have that precious painting stolen.
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, God, Lily, you didn't...?"
08x17,Unknown,Of course I didn't.
08x17,Unknown,I stole this ashtray instead.
08x17,Unknown,"Lily! Hey, you know the rules."
08x17,Unknown,"You misbehave, I take away one of your toys."
08x17,Unknown,"Aldrin Justice, baby."
08x17,Unknown,"So you're telling me that that ashtray that's been in our apartment for over a year and a half is not only stolen, but also very expensive."
08x17,Unknown,Both of those things-- yes.
08x17,Unknown,"Guys, can you leave us alone for a minute, please?"
08x17,Unknown,"Ooh, they're gonna do it."
08x17,Unknown,"No, we're gonna fight."
08x17,Unknown,And then maybe afterwards we'll do it.
08x17,Unknown,I can't believe that was the same ashtray.
08x17,Unknown,I should've recognized it.
08x17,Unknown,"I know-- me, too."
08x17,Unknown,"Barney, you weren't there."
08x17,Unknown,Why is it so important that you be part of this story?
08x17,Unknown,Because crazy stories are my thing.
08x17,Unknown,"You have architecture, Marshall has the law, Lily has art, Robin has pleasing me sexually."
08x17,Unknown,You all have a passion that drives you.
08x17,Unknown,"Well, if I have a passion, it's taking life and turning it into a series of crazy stories."
08x17,Unknown,"If you can do that without me, then..."
08x17,Unknown,I don't even know who I am anymore.
08x17,Unknown,"You know what, Barney?"
08x17,Unknown,"Now that I think about it, you were there."
08x17,Unknown,"That's right, you were."
08x17,Unknown,I was? Yeah.
08x17,Unknown,"I mean, I know I was."
08x17,Unknown,"That's what I'm saying, guys."
08x17,Unknown,"We just, uh... we just didn't realize it because... you were in disguise."
08x17,Unknown,"Yeah, you were doing, uh, one of your plays from the playbook."
08x17,Unknown,"On Shelly, the art consultant."
08x17,Unknown,"Yes, it was, uh, some play that had to do with art..."
08x17,Unknown,The Royal Archduke of Grand Fenwick?
08x17,Unknown,A simple play you can do using two everyday household objects--
08x17,Unknown,a Prussian military costume and an oil painting of yourself?
08x17,Unknown,"That's the one, and it worked on Shelly."
08x17,Unknown,I totally nailed her!
08x17,Unknown,And then I nailed her sister who was even hotter.
08x17,Unknown,(laughing)
08x17,Unknown,Good times.
08x17,Unknown,"You are gonna return that ashtray, and you're gonna pray that he doesn't press charges, because I can't be in a marriage where one of us is in prison."
08x17,Unknown,"I know that we role-play conjugal visits a lot, but I can't do that for realsies."
08x17,Unknown,I'm sorry--
08x17,Unknown,all rulings are final.
08x17,Unknown,I am not taking it back.
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, my God!"
08x17,Unknown,"Lily, what is the big deal?"
08x17,Unknown,"Okay, so what?"
08x17,Unknown,So he said you're just a kindergarten teacher.
08x17,Unknown,Why do you let that bother you?
08x17,Unknown,Because he was right.
08x17,Unknown,I am just a kindergarten teacher.
08x17,Unknown,"And, yes, I have a degree in art history and I was meant to do something with it, but I didn't."
08x17,Unknown,"Somewhere along the line, I forgot to pursue my dream, and... and now I'm old and I'm a mom and it's just too late for me."
08x17,Unknown,"Lily, okay, okay."
08x17,Unknown,"It's too late. No, no, no, it's not too... it's not too late."
08x17,Unknown,"You're gonna quit your job tomorrow, and you're gonna... you're gonna go back and pick up right where you left off with that art stuff."
08x17,Unknown,And then you know what?
08x17,Unknown,"I'm gonna find Shelly, and I'm gonna punch her in the face."
08x17,Unknown,I am-- I'm gonna punch a girl... and run away.
08x17,Unknown,Look.
08x17,Unknown,"I promise you, your best and your most exciting days are all ahead of you."
08x17,Unknown,"I love you so much for saying that, but there gets to be a point in life where that just stops being true."
08x17,Unknown,I'm sorry I stole this.
08x17,Unknown,I'll return it first thing tomorrow.
08x17,Unknown,Narrator
08x17,Unknown,"And so the next day, Lily returned to the Captain's apartment."
08x17,Unknown,"Well, how about that."
08x17,Unknown,I didn't even realize it was gone.
08x17,Unknown,No harm done.
08x17,Unknown,"Wait, if you weren't calling about the ashtray, then why'd you want to see me?"
08x17,Unknown,Follow me.
08x17,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh."
08x17,Unknown,"Yep, that night, I ducked back down into the gallery and bought it."
08x17,Unknown,Shelly didn't stop you?
08x17,Unknown,Shelly was off with some archduke she met at the party.
08x17,Unknown,"No, I just... well, I liked what you said about how you just liked it."
08x17,Unknown,I still do.
08x17,Unknown,"Me, too."
08x17,Unknown,"Anyway, I just sold it for $4 million."
08x17,Unknown,What?
08x17,Unknown,"In the year and a half since I bought this piece, the artist has turned into a huge star in the art world."
08x17,Unknown,"The next Basquiat, they're saying."
08x17,Unknown,And nobody saw it coming except you.
08x17,Unknown,So I've decided to give you half my earnings from the sale.
08x17,Unknown,(gasps)
08x17,Unknown,I'm just kidding.
08x17,Unknown,I'm not giving you two million bucks.
08x17,Unknown,(groans)
08x17,Unknown,"I mean, I could."
08x17,Unknown,Easily-- it wouldn't even make a dent for me.
08x17,Unknown,"But trust me, the tax code being what it is, you do not want to be rich right now."
08x17,Unknown,So here's what I'm thinking.
08x17,Unknown,"I want to get back in the art game, and I need a new art consultant."
08x17,Unknown,"Wait, are you offering me a job?"
08x17,Unknown,If you want it.
08x17,Unknown,What do you say?
08x17,Unknown,"And she said yes. Guys, it was amazing!"
08x17,Unknown,You should have been there. Barney!
08x17,Unknown,You were not there. Let her tell her story.
08x17,Unknown,Guys! You were not there.
08x17,Unknown,"What did you say, baby?"
08x17,Unknown,I said yes.
08x17,Unknown,Ha! Told you!
08x17,Unknown,How would I know that she was going to say...?
08x17,Unknown,♪
08x17,Unknown,(bell rings)
08x18,Unknown,Marshall
08x18,Unknown,This is the life.
08x18,Unknown,We got the three B's.
08x18,Unknown,"Beach, booze and bodacious babes."
08x18,Unknown,I don't know.
08x18,Unknown,I'm starting to think we should call the police.
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, would you relax?"
08x18,Unknown,We've got it made.
08x18,Unknown,"One whole week at his bodacious beach house, no strings attached."
08x18,Unknown,"Well, there is one string attached."
08x18,Unknown,"Hi, Barney."
08x18,Unknown,Both
08x18,,Bodacious.
08x18,Unknown,(gasps)
08x18,Unknown,"""Weekend at Barney's!"""
08x18,Unknown,What is it? What's wrong?
08x18,Unknown,"The plays, Robin, the plays."
08x18,Unknown,The ingenious techniques I used as a bachelor to pick up busty dullards.
08x18,Unknown,They just keep coming to me; I can't turn them off.
08x18,Unknown,"Okay, Barney, let me ease your mind, okay?"
08x18,Unknown,"All right, here we go."
08x18,Unknown,Remember when you set your Playbook on fire?
08x18,Unknown,That was the moment I realized you were someone I could marry.
08x18,Unknown,And I'd burn it again if I could.
08x18,Unknown,You're right.
08x18,Unknown,I'm done with all these plays.
08x18,Unknown,"Besides, there's no way I'll ever come up with anything that tops ""Weekend at Barney's."""
08x18,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x18,Unknown,"""Weekend at Barney's Two!"""

08x18,Unknown,Weekend at Barney's
08x18,Unknown,"Original Air Date on February 25, 2013"
08x18,Unknown,"So, there's this big gallery opening tonight."
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, we'd love to, but we've got this, um..."
08x18,Unknown,"Genesis reunion, Madison Square Garden, front row."
08x18,Unknown,It's gonna be legend...
08x18,Unknown,I wasn't inviting you guys.
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, thank God. There is no concert."
08x18,Unknown,"As the captain's new art buyer, I have to go schmooze this up-and-coming artist, Strickland Stevens, so we get first dibs on all his new stuff."
08x18,Unknown,And I'll be helping Lily seal the deal by impressing the intelligentsia with some art-related hilarity.
08x18,Unknown,I've prepared some jokes.
08x18,Unknown,Why couldn't the art dealer pay his rent?
08x18,Unknown,I don't know. Why?
08x18,Unknown,This is gonna be rough.
08x18,Unknown,Because he ran out of Monet.
08x18,Unknown,You're gonna get that on the walk home. How about this one?
08x18,Unknown,"You know what, we'd... we'd love to hear it, but we've got that, um... that..."
08x18,Unknown,"Steely Dan, Carnegie Hall, backstage pass. Let's go."
08x18,Unknown,We don't want to miss whatever their big song was.
08x18,Unknown,Yeah.
08x18,Unknown,"Your wedding response card, as promised."
08x18,Unknown,Why didn't you just mail it like everybody else?
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, see, that's sad, Robin."
08x18,Unknown,You should be touched that I hand-delivered it.
08x18,Unknown,Has social media so eroded our interpersonal relationships that we no longer wish to experience the...
08x18,Unknown,You wanted to keep the stamp?
08x18,Unknown,They're 46 cents now.
08x18,Unknown,"It's getting out of hand. ""Your invitation is joyfully accepted by Mr. Ted Mosby and Jeanette"""""
08x18,Unknown,(groaning)
08x18,Unknown,Narrator
08x18,Unknown,"Kids, as you'll recall, Jeanette was the last girl I dated before I met your mother."
08x18,Unknown,My friends only had one tiny problem with her.
08x18,Unknown,(alarm buzzing)
08x18,Unknown,She was nuts.
08x18,Unknown,So you're bringing a plus one?
08x18,Unknown,"If you count the voices in her head, it's plus five."
08x18,Unknown,"Guys, I'm bringing her, and you're gonna love having her there."
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, and, um, by the way, just so this doesn't turn into an argument later, the dress she's gonna wear isn't technically white; it's eggshell."
08x18,Unknown,"The shoes are white, though."
08x18,Unknown,And the gloves.
08x18,Unknown,"And the veil. Well, see you guys."
08x18,Unknown,"No, no, no. Mosby! Get..."
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, my God, what happened?"
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, I trashed your apartment."
08x18,Unknown,"See, I got bored, so I started going through all your e-mails."
08x18,Unknown,"Sure. And I found one from a woman with the subject line, ""big penis orgasms,"" so naturally, I smashed your plates, knifed your mattress, peed in your drawers, the whole nine, but then, while I was upper-decking your toilet, I actually read the e-mail."
08x18,Unknown,Turns out it was spam.
08x18,Unknown,"Classic Jeanette, huh?"
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, my God."
08x18,Unknown,You are certifiably insane...
08x18,Unknown,...about me.
08x18,Unknown,"Come here, you knucklehead."
08x18,Unknown,I can't stay mad at you.
08x18,Unknown,"Ted, Ted, I'm breaking up with you."
08x18,Unknown,"You're just so intense, and it's all moving way too fast."
08x18,Unknown,Here's your key back.
08x18,Unknown,I never gave you a key.
08x18,Unknown,And here's your grandmother's ring.
08x18,Unknown,She was buried wearing this.
08x18,Unknown,"And just like that,"
08x18,Unknown,it was over.
08x18,Unknown,I texted Barney and Robin.
08x18,Unknown,I'm sure they're over the moon that Jeanette's not coming to the wedding.
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, no, Ted, no."
08x18,Unknown,They're not gonna be happy about you being sad.
08x18,Unknown,They broke up!
08x18,Unknown,(screaming)
08x18,Unknown,"Ted, respectfully, are you sure that this was the right girl for you?"
08x18,Unknown,Of course not.
08x18,Unknown,She was crazy.
08x18,Unknown,Absolutely a nightmare.
08x18,Unknown,It's totally not worth the trouble.
08x18,Unknown,"I mean, no matter how... no matter how great the sex was."
08x18,Unknown,"Uh-oh. Stay with us, buddy."
08x18,Unknown,"No matter how hot and passionate and surprising, possibly illegal..."
08x18,Unknown,"I don't like this. Me, neither."
08x18,Unknown,I'm gonna win her back.
08x18,Unknown,(groaning)
08x18,Unknown,Barney and Robin are gonna be so happy I'm happy.
08x18,Unknown,(sobbing)
08x18,Unknown,I know.
08x18,Unknown,I know.
08x18,Unknown,Did you just unhook my bra?
08x18,Unknown,"Shh. There, there."
08x18,Unknown,Narrator
08x18,Unknown,That night was the big gallery show.
08x18,Unknown,Hey. I'm so sorry.
08x18,Unknown,I decided to grab a snack from the bodega.
08x18,Unknown,Why?
08x18,Unknown,They'll have food at the gallery.
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, come on, these places never have food."
08x18,Unknown,It's fine.
08x18,Unknown,I got some Skittles.
08x18,Unknown,Narrator
08x18,Unknown,That was the last bag of Skittles your Uncle Marshall would ever buy.
08x18,Unknown,"Meanwhile, I headed over to Jeanette's place to win her back."
08x18,Unknown,(bell dings)
08x18,Unknown,(doors close)
08x18,Unknown,What the hell?
08x18,Unknown,"I can't let you do this, Ted."
08x18,Unknown,I want Jeanette back.
08x18,Unknown,"Well, then accept my apology."
08x18,Unknown,For what?
08x18,Unknown,(sighs)
08x18,Unknown,This.
08x18,Unknown,"Ow, ow, ow! Damn it! You're strong."
08x18,Unknown,That's just from Pilates?
08x18,Unknown,Twice a week.
08x18,Unknown,"Look, I don't want you getting back with Jeanette."
08x18,Unknown,"Ted, what is my one rule?"
08x18,Unknown,You can tell how old a girl is by her elbows?
08x18,Unknown,My other one rule.
08x18,Unknown,Flaxseed relieves upset stomach?
08x18,Unknown,My other one rule.
08x18,Unknown,Always have a fake pair of concert tickets in your pocket in case Lily invites you to something stupid?
08x18,Unknown,My other one rule.
08x18,Unknown,Lebanese girls sprint to third base and then stay there?
08x18,Unknown,My other one rule. New is always better.
08x18,Unknown,New is always better!
08x18,Unknown,"Exactly, Ted."
08x18,Unknown,"You want to invite a date to our wedding, it is not gonna be Jeanette."
08x18,Unknown,It is gonna be someone new.
08x18,Unknown,And I am gonna help you find her with a little help from...
08x18,Unknown,The Playbook.
08x18,Unknown,The Playbook?
08x18,Unknown,Didn't you burn that?
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, I didn't burn the real one."
08x18,Unknown,"That was the ceremonial playbook for parades, mall openings, inaugurations, stuff like that."
08x18,Unknown,That's a pretty big secret to keep from Robin.
08x18,Unknown,"Which is exactly why I'm trusting you, my best bro, to never let her know that the Playbook still exists."
08x18,Unknown,Pinky swear?
08x18,Unknown,Fine.
08x18,Unknown,Wow.
08x18,Unknown,"See, I told you."
08x18,Unknown,Thank God I snuck in this bag of goodness.
08x18,Unknown,(gasps)
08x18,Unknown,There's Strickland Stevens.
08x18,Unknown,Marshall
08x18,,Wow.
08x18,Unknown,Even his scarf is up-and-coming.
08x18,Unknown,Are you gonna be okay by yourself for a few minutes?
08x18,Unknown,"Yeah, of course. Why wouldn't I be?"
08x18,Unknown,"Well, you're sitting on an $80,000 sculpture."
08x18,Unknown,"For 80 grand, you'd think it would be more comfortable."
08x18,Unknown,"Lil, I'll be fine."
08x18,Unknown,Do you know who you're talking to?
08x18,Unknown,"In high school, I was voted most outgoing freshman, sophomore and senior year."
08x18,Unknown,What happened junior year?
08x18,Unknown,"Egdud Ferhaki, that outgoing son of a b*tch."
08x18,Unknown,He beat you for most outgoing?
08x18,Unknown,"Huh? Oh, no, we tied."
08x18,Unknown,"Look, the point is, I can make friends anywhere, even here."
08x18,Unknown,"Thanks, baby. You got it."
08x18,Unknown,(clicks tongue)
08x18,Unknown,"Hey, excuse me."
08x18,Unknown,Listen.
08x18,Unknown,"Do you think that you would enjoy a show featuring Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo?"
08x18,Unknown,Sound like you're a fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
08x18,Unknown,Gotcha. Skin it.
08x18,Unknown,He will get that on the drive home.
08x18,Unknown,Narrator
08x18,Unknown,He didn't.
08x18,Unknown,Fireworks? Yeah.
08x18,Unknown,Everything in there is a prop we'll need for tonight.
08x18,Unknown,Everything.
08x18,Unknown,"All right, here's how this is going down."
08x18,Unknown,You'll be wearing this earpiece and microphone.
08x18,Unknown,"I'll be staked out here, telling you exactly what to say, so just stay focused and you'll be fine."
08x18,Unknown,Which play are we gonna run first?
08x18,Unknown,"How about the ""Weekend at Barney's""?"
08x18,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, Ted, your first day at the salon, and you want to do a cut and color?"
08x18,Unknown,No.
08x18,Unknown,Tonight we're gonna start off with...
08x18,Unknown,Ice Man to Neruda.
08x18,Unknown,Ice Man to Neruda.
08x18,Bogey at 10,"00, and she is packing two fully-operational sweater stretchers."
08x18,Unknown,"That's bravo, Oscar, Oscar, bravo, Sierra."
08x18,Unknown,Possible delta cups.
08x18,Unknown,Copy that. Engaging target.
08x18,Unknown,Over.
08x18,Unknown,"Excuse me, I have a delivery for Lisa."
08x18,Unknown,"Excuse me, I have a delivery for Lisa."
08x18,Unknown,Are you Lisa? Are you Lisa?
08x18,Unknown,"Uh, no."
08x18,Unknown,But you must be.
08x18,Unknown,I was told to...
08x18,Unknown,"...deliver this package to a girl named Lisa, and that I'd recognize her because she'd be..."
08x18,Unknown,The most beautiful girl in this bar.
08x18,Unknown,"So, here's your delivery, Lisa."
08x18,Unknown,"Uh, I am definitely not Lisa, but I would be happy to help you find her."
08x18,Unknown,"Great, and then maybe later..."
08x18,Unknown,I could give you a different package-- my penis.
08x18,Unknown,That is a terrible line!
08x18,Unknown,You said it wrong.
08x18,Unknown,I did not say it wrong.
08x18,Unknown,My penis.
08x18,Unknown,No. My penis.
08x18,Unknown,"Still not right. My penis, my penis, my penis!"
08x18,(muttering),Hello.
08x18,Unknown,Lily
08x18,Unknown,This sucks.
08x18,Unknown,I can't get near Strickland.
08x18,Unknown,At least Marshall's having a good time.
08x18,Unknown,"Man, he always knows just the right thing to say."
08x18,Unknown,"For a gay guy, Andy Warhol sure liked cans."
08x18,Unknown,This sucks.
08x18,Unknown,Maybe I've lost my charm.
08x18,Unknown,"No, Marshall, if Lily's gonna make it in this fancy art world, you're gonna have to make it, too, so suck it up, stop sitting on the art,"
08x18,Unknown,"and bust out the ""A"" material."
08x18,Unknown,"You two keep chugging like that, you're gonna have to Vincent van"
08x18,Unknown,go
08x18,Unknown,"to the bathroom, am I right?"
08x18,Unknown,It's pronounced van
08x18,Unknown,Gogh.
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, ""blogh"" me."
08x18,Unknown,I still don't get why someone would leave the hospital without changing into their clothes first. Over.
08x18,Unknown,"Ted, this is my thing."
08x18,Unknown,So just... okay?
08x18,Unknown,Over.
08x18,Unknown,Okay? Over.
08x18,Unknown,Are you all right?
08x18,Unknown,What? Oh.
08x18,Unknown,"Yes, yes, I'm fine."
08x18,Unknown,"Tomorrow, I'm... donating a kidney to my best friend."
08x18,Unknown,My best friend Barney.
08x18,Unknown,Not Marshall.
08x18,Unknown,Barney.
08x18,Unknown,Marshall's so lame.
08x18,Unknown,"Anyway, uh... just wanted to grab one last drink, in case... you know, I don't make it."
08x18,Unknown,You are so brave.
08x18,Unknown,"Hey, listen. (clears throat)"
08x18,Unknown,"Before I give my best friend this organ, how about..."
08x18,Unknown,Nope.
08x18,Unknown,"Nope, I'm not saying that."
08x18,Unknown,"I did hear you, but I'm not saying that."
08x18,Unknown,Because I'm not.
08x18,Unknown,Are you okay?
08x18,Unknown,One second. I know you put a lot of work into this.
08x18,Unknown,I understand that.
08x18,Unknown,I understand that.
08x18,Unknown,I understand that.
08x18,Unknown,I understand that.
08x18,Unknown,Why can't I just talk to her?
08x18,Unknown,Maybe we'll hit it off...
08x18,Unknown,(sighs)
08x18,Unknown,Fine.
08x18,Unknown,Copy that.
08x18,Unknown,(clears throat)
08x18,Unknown,How about I give you a different organ?
08x18,Unknown,My penis.
08x18,Unknown,You said it wrong.
08x18,Unknown,I did not say it wrong!
08x18,Unknown,Thank you all so much for coming.
08x18,Unknown,"If you'll indulge me, I would like to share a story about my dearly departed grandmother."
08x18,Unknown,Marshall
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, God."
08x18,"News flash, Johnny Ascot",Lots of people have dead grandmas.
08x18,Unknown,"No, Marshall."
08x18,Unknown,Don't be bitter.
08x18,Unknown,You're here for Lily.
08x18,Unknown,"Just look at her, so professional."
08x18,Unknown,She hasn't sat on a single piece of art.
08x18,Unknown,You're gonna ride this thing out with dignity for Lily.
08x18,Unknown,Not one more thing that might embarrass her.
08x18,Unknown,I will simply stand here.
08x18,Unknown,Perfectly invisible.
08x18,Unknown,And so I dedicate this show to my grandmother's memory.
08x18,Unknown,Now... please join me in honoring her with 60 seconds of absolute silence.
08x18,Unknown,(clattering)
08x18,Unknown,(one Skittle rattles on floor)
08x18,Unknown,Barney
08x18,,"Okay, Neruda, this play is extremely complicated."
08x18,Unknown,"Let me guess. Does it involve me saying ""my penis"" in a Scottish accent?"
08x18,(Scottish accent),"Now you're gettin' it, laddie!"
08x18,Unknown,Hey!
08x18,Unknown,Robin. What are you doing here?
08x18,Unknown,"I was curious as to whether you found Ted a date to our wedding who was a little less, you know, Antichrist-y."
08x18,Unknown,Is that the Playbook?
08x18,Unknown,"No, Robin, that is a couch."
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, you mean the Playbook"
08x18,Unknown,on
08x18,Unknown,the couch?
08x18,Unknown,I can explain.
08x18,Unknown,Don't bother.
08x18,Unknown,"I can ex... Uh, Ted? Uh..."
08x18,Unknown,I got to step away from mission control for a sec.
08x18,Unknown,Don't do anything stupid while I'm gone.
08x18,Unknown,Robin...
08x18,Unknown,(no dialogue)
08x18,Unknown,"Robin, wait."
08x18,Unknown,Um... sh**t. I haven't figured out what I'm gonna say yet. Keep going.
08x18,Unknown,"Robin, wait."
08x18,Unknown,"Look, I'm sorry that I still have the Playbook."
08x18,Unknown,"It's just, it's filled with a lifetime of great ideas."
08x18,Unknown,Am I supposed to just leave all that behind?
08x18,Unknown,"Yes. But... ""Weekend at Barney's""!"
08x18,Unknown,"Okay, what is that?"
08x18,Unknown,"Explain the ""Weekend at Barney's"" to me."
08x18,Unknown,What's to explain?
08x18,Unknown,"I play a dead guy, and Ted and Marshall carry me around."
08x18,Unknown,"Okay. And based on that, girls want to sleep with you."
08x18,Unknown,Big time. But you're dead.
08x18,Unknown,"Yeah. Except not really, obviously."
08x18,Unknown,But the girl thinks you're dead.
08x18,Unknown,"No, she thinks I'm alive."
08x18,Unknown,Which you are. Exactly.
08x18,Unknown,Except you're dead. Exactly.
08x18,Unknown,Except you're alive. Exactly.
08x18,Unknown,"Okay, so instead of... of being an alive person pretending to be a dead person pretending to be an alive person, why not just be an alive person?"
08x18,Unknown,"Okay, let's start from the beginning."
08x18,Unknown,The movie is called
08x18,Unknown,Weekend at Bernie's.
08x18,Unknown,My name is Barney.
08x18,Unknown,"I'm so sorry, sweetie."
08x18,Unknown,"I don't know if you heard, but I dropped some Skittles."
08x18,Unknown,"Do you know what, I'm just gonna go home before I make things worse."
08x18,Unknown,You're not going anywhere.
08x18,Unknown,We're a team.
08x18,Unknown,You stuck by me after my nip slip at your law school graduation.
08x18,Unknown,And after my nip slip at the GNB Christmas party.
08x18,Unknown,And after my nip slip at the Honeywell and Coots Family Fun Day.
08x18,Unknown,I don't know why you keep wearing that top.
08x18,Unknown,"All right, I'll stay put, but I'm keeping my mouth shut."
08x18,Unknown,"No more jokes, no more candy, no more Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."
08x18,Unknown,"Hey, are you guys talking Ninja Turtles?"
08x18,Unknown,I'm a huge TMNT fan.
08x18,Unknown,I grew up on those comic books.
08x18,Unknown,"Me, too! I was obsessed."
08x18,Unknown,Did you know that the original comic debuted in 1984 at a convention in New Hampshire?
08x18,Unknown,"Uh, yes."
08x18,Unknown,Did you know that Eastman and Laird always had their doubts about their characters being commercialized?
08x18,Unknown,Yes!
08x18,Unknown,Did you know that the painting on the back wall is inspired by Master Splinter?
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, the one of the rat doing karate."
08x18,Unknown,I see it now.
08x18,Unknown,"Hey, I'm Strickland."
08x18,Unknown,Hey. Marshall.
08x18,Unknown,"And this is my wife, Lily, who, as a matter of fact, happens to represent one of the biggest art collectors in New York City."
08x18,Unknown,I love your work.
08x18,Unknown,It's great to see you getting some recognition.
08x18,Unknown,Thank you. It's been a long haul.
08x18,Unknown,"The first painting I ever sold, I used the money to get my car fixed."
08x18,Unknown,You might say...
08x18,Unknown,I used it to make my
08x18,Unknown,van go.
08x18,(laughing),That's...
08x18,Unknown,(laughing)
08x18,Unknown,"Um, a little something called rigor mortis?"
08x18,Unknown,"Oh, come on."
08x18,Unknown,Are you really this mad about a book?
08x18,Unknown,"You really think that this is just about a book, Barney?"
08x18,Unknown,You lied to me.
08x18,Unknown,"If we're gonna be in a marriage and trust each other, you can't lie to me ever."
08x18,Unknown,Really?
08x18,Unknown,"Well, that's just great."
08x18,Unknown,"Because, in case you haven't noticed these last eight years, lying is what I do best."
08x18,Unknown,"I'm a magician, Robin."
08x18,Unknown,Misdirection and deceit are my stock in trade.
08x18,Unknown,You don't want me to lie to you?
08x18,Unknown,Lies are the reason that we're together.
08x18,Unknown,Everything single thing I did to get you to say yes to me on that rooftop--
08x18,Unknown,"Patrice, the false engagement, everything--"
08x18,Unknown,it was all utter malarkey.
08x18,Unknown,But... underneath all of those lies is one true thing.
08x18,Unknown,"One true thing that can support the weight of all the lies in the world, and... and that's the fact that I love you."
08x18,Unknown,And you know that when I say that...
08x18,Unknown,I am not lying.
08x18,Unknown,Wha...
08x18,Unknown,Did you just unhook my bra again?
08x18,Unknown,(Barney shushes)
08x18,Unknown,Ted
08x18,Unknown,"Jeanette,"
08x18,Unknown,this is great.
08x18,Unknown,We're back together.
08x18,Unknown,You're coming to Barney and Robin's wedding.
08x18,Unknown,I found two wine glasses you didn't smash.
08x18,Unknown,"Call me crazy, but I've got a feeling, from here on out, it's gonna be nothing but blue skies and..."
08x18,Unknown,What... the hell... is this?!

08x19,Unknown,15 times on the forums!
08x19,Unknown,"No, I can't."
08x19,Unknown,I promised Lily that I would wait and watch it with her.
08x19,Unknown,"Problem is, the Captain."

08x19,Unknown,"Lily had just started a job as the art consultant for an eccentric billionaire, the Captain."

08x19,Unknown,A scathing indictment of capitalism.

08x19,Unknown,The artist is serving two consecutive life sentences for aggravated homicide.
08x19,Unknown,I'm willing to go as high as six cartons of cigarettes and a jug of toilet wine.
08x19,Unknown,"Is it a strain, feeling like a single dad at times?"
08x19,Unknown,"Sure, but Lily's been busting her butt at this new job."

08x19,Unknown,Please?
08x19,Unknown,My son... for many years this apartment has been my Fortress of Barnitude.
08x19,Unknown,But now the time has come for me to pass it on.
08x19,Unknown,"Soon, this place will become your ""Fortress of Soli-Ted."""
08x19,Unknown,"Barney, I wouldn't live here even if you scrubbed every inch of this place with Purell, amoxicillin and holy water."
08x19,Unknown,(sighs)
08x19,Unknown,Fine.
08x19,Unknown,"But I think we can both agree, it would be totally awesome to see my deal floating around all huge-like on the big Jor-El cam."
08x19,Unknown,Hold on.
08x19,Unknown,(unzips)

08x19,Unknown,"That's... okay, that's not funny."
08x19,Unknown,"Ted, open the..."

08x19,Unknown,"Wait a... wait a minute, that's it?"
08x19,Unknown,"Ted wasn't interested in buying your apartment, so you just gave up?"
08x19,Unknown,"Barney, I gave up my beautiful two-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side that was rent-free and the landlord hand-washed all my delicates."
08x19,Unknown,Which is probably why it was rent-free.
08x19,Unknown,"The point is, I need to buy all new underwear, and you agreed that we would find a new place together."
08x19,Unknown,"Oh, God, Barney, relationships are about trust and compromise."
08x19,Unknown,You can't just...
08x19,Unknown,"Oh, you are so dead."
08x19,Unknown,"If I ever figure a way out of here, I will make your life a living..."
08x19,Unknown,Lily and I really need this night out.

08x19,Unknown,you.

08x19,Unknown,"Oh, hey, baby."

08x19,Unknown,If you get there before...

08x19,Unknown,I'll see you later.
08x19,Unknown,Captain?
08x19,"I'm sorry, dude. But, hey, look at it this way",now you don't have to go to the ballet.
08x19,Unknown,"Get your head out of your ass, Ted."
08x19,Unknown,There was no ballet.
08x19,Unknown,We were gonna sneak into your apartment and bang.
08x19,Unknown,"Well, you know what might take both our minds off that?"
08x19,Unknown,"A little, uh..."
08x19,Unknown,(clears throat)
08x19,(whispering),Woodworthy Manor.
08x19,Unknown,"No, I-I-I can't."
08x19,Unknown,I-I promised Lily that I would wait and watch it with her.
08x19,Unknown,And I feel like I'd be cheating on her.
08x19,Unknown,"Sure, sure, sure, sure, I get all that."
08x19,Unknown,"It's just, um..."
08x19,Unknown,"You know, tonight they're gonna finally reveal who framed the chimney sweep for stealing Lord Stoutshire's gooseberries."
08x19,Unknown,And reveal the winner of the local gardening competition.
08x19,Unknown,I don't know how they're going to pack all that action into one episode.

08x19,Unknown,I see what this is.
08x19,Unknown,You finally green-lit my orgy idea!
08x19,Unknown,Okay.
08x19,Unknown,"It's an open house, Barney."
08x19,Unknown,Say good-bye to your fortress.
08x19,Unknown,"If we weren't about to have an orgy, I'd be so mad at you right now."
08x19,Unknown,"If you'll follow me into the bedroom, I'll show you some beautiful woodwork."
08x19,Unknown,I am way too upset right now to point out how many women have seen some beautiful woodwork in there.
08x19,Unknown,Angry self five!
08x19,Unknown,Rah!
08x19,Unknown,"Robin, I did not agree to this."
08x19,Unknown,"Yes, you did."
08x19,Unknown,That is why I gave up my apartment.
08x19,Unknown,Not so I could live in a disease-riddled bang pad haunted by the ghosts of your ex-skanks.
08x19,Unknown,The bathrooms are Italian marble.

08x19,Unknown,What are you doing here?
08x19,Unknown,And why do you sound like Madonna?

08x19,Unknown,What are you doing?
08x19,Unknown,"Well, you were late yet again, and so I'm gonna do this little scene study with Ted."
08x19,Unknown,Why? Because he's there for me.
08x19,Unknown,Pretending you're married?
08x19,Unknown,"That's going a little far to prove your point, isn't it?"
08x19,Unknown,"Excuse me, but I think it's offensive to suggest the only reason gay people get married is to prove a point."
08x19,Unknown,"No, no, no, no, no."
08x19,Unknown,I didn't... that's not what I...
08x19,Unknown,"Thank you, sister--"

08x19,Unknown,"Oh, is this part of a security system?"
08x19,Unknown,Sort of.
08x19,Unknown,It's connected to the welcome mat. You see...

08x19,Unknown,"Funny, you sound like someone who's been around for his bedtime lately."
08x19,Unknown,"Uh, can somebody get this lady a storefront 'cause she needs to mind her own business, mm-kay?"
08x19,Unknown,(other clapping)
08x19,Unknown,Would you stop it?

08x19,Unknown,"""I'm looking for a deeper commitment."""
08x19,Unknown,(alarm ringing)
08x19,Unknown,"It's also triggered by ""I'm too tired,"" ""Let's snuggle,"""
08x19,Unknown,"and ""I'm a week late."""
08x19,Unknown,"Barney, I'm getting wet."
08x19,Unknown,And that turns it off.
08x19,Unknown,"Look, just stop talking."
08x19,Unknown,We've made up our minds.
08x19,Unknown,"Oh, well, thanks for taking a look."
08x19,Unknown,I'll walk you out.
08x19,Unknown,We'll take it.
08x19,Unknown,(Robin gasps)
08x19,Unknown,"If you never get a black light, you'll be so happy here."
08x19,Unknown,(screams happily)
08x19,Unknown,"Yes, yes!"
08x19,Unknown,"Yes, yes."
08x19,Unknown,(whoops)
08x19,Unknown,"(gentle, majestic music plays)"
08x19,Unknown,Trouble in paradise?
08x19,Unknown,We have a child together.
08x19,Unknown,(alarm ringing)
08x19,Unknown,I can't believe you watched
08x19,Unknown,Woodworthy Manor
08x19,Unknown,without me.
08x19,Unknown,I can't believe that you're mad at me.
08x19,Unknown,I've been abandoned by my wife and my gay companion.
08x19,Unknown,"If I get blinded in one eye by a badminton shuttlecock, you might as well call me Lord Esterbrooke."
08x19,Unknown,(both gasp)
08x19,Unknown,You watched the new one without me?
08x19,Unknown,"Betrayal stings, doesn't it, Emsbry?"
08x19,Unknown,Hey.
08x19,Unknown,Hey. Listen.
08x19,Unknown,"I... No, me first."
08x19,Unknown,I've been thinking and I realized something.
08x19,Unknown,The Fortress of Solitude is where Superman went to be alone.
08x19,Unknown,And I never want to be alone again.
08x19,Unknown,"Thank you, Barney, that really..."
08x19,Unknown,But then I remembered in
08x19,Unknown,"Superman II,"
08x19,Unknown,"Superman gave up all his powers to be with Lois Lane, and he was honestly kind of a vag after that."
08x19,Unknown,"Oh, buddy, just quit while..."
08x19,Unknown,"Now,"
08x19,Unknown,Superman III
08x19,Unknown,was a complete train wreck totally.
08x19,Unknown,What's your point?
08x19,Unknown,That... that I love you.
08x19,Unknown,And...
08x19,Unknown,I'm giving up my apartment for you.
08x19,Unknown,And that the Superman films are uneven.
08x19,Unknown,"I really appreciate that, Barney, but..."
08x19,Unknown,after you left...
08x19,Unknown,Congrats. You guys are getting a fantastic apartment.
08x19,Unknown,"I mean, I know some of the features are a little weird."
08x19,Unknown,A little?
08x19,Unknown,We're gonna rip this thing down to the studs.
08x19,Unknown,I get it.
08x19,Unknown,"But, I mean, some things might be worth saving."
08x19,Unknown,I don't see any. No.
08x19,Unknown,You don't see any?
08x19,Unknown,"Sure some of the stuff in here is creepy, but it's also brilliant."
08x19,Unknown,"I mean, a lot of geniuses were kind of pervy."
08x19,Unknown,Look at Thomas Edison--
08x19,Unknown,why do you think that lightbulbs are boob-shaped?
08x19,Unknown,"Yeah, we're taking a wrecking ball to this place and turning it into something actually fit for humans."
08x19,Unknown,(laughs)
08x19,Unknown,Excuse me.
08x19,Unknown,"(talking low, indistinctly)"
08x19,Unknown,(door closes)
08x19,(booming voice),Get out!
08x19,Unknown,The Fortress of Barnitude is no longer for sale.
08x19,Unknown,Also your husband has been staring at my ass all afternoon so don't act all high-and-mighty.
08x19,Unknown,You turned them down?
08x19,Unknown,"Yeah. If I ask you to change too many things about yourself, you're not gonna be the man I fell in love with."
08x19,Unknown,"Turns out, I accept and appreciate even the grossest, creepiest, most sociopathic parts of you."
08x19,Unknown,(laughs)
08x19,Unknown,Sounds like somebody just wrote her vows.
08x19,Unknown,(quiet laugh)
08x19,Unknown,Mm.
08x19,Unknown,(phone rings)
08x19,Unknown,It's the Captain.
08x19,Unknown,Ahoy.
08x19,Unknown,There's a zebra at the Central Park Zoo who's got quite a keen hoof at photography.
08x19,Unknown,"Ironically, he's great with color. Now..."
08x19,Unknown,"Captain, I'll check it out, just not tonight."
08x19,Unknown,I need to spend some time with my husband.
08x19,Unknown,You sure?
08x19,Unknown,"I know it's been tough, me working this much, and I guess I went a little overboard with the whole artsy thing."
08x19,(laughing),I know.
08x19,Unknown,The cape.
08x19,Unknown,What about my cape?
08x19,Unknown,I love it.
08x19,Unknown,And I...
08x19,Unknown,I know that you love this job.
08x19,Unknown,I should be more supportive--
08x19,Unknown,I just miss you.
08x19,Unknown,"I miss you, too."
08x19,Unknown,"Hey, guys."
08x19,Unknown,Hey. Hey.
08x19,Unknown,You guys are all so lucky.
08x19,Unknown,When am I gonna find something real?
08x19,Unknown,"Well, Emsbry, ready to see what it's like to be with a woman?"
08x19,(British accent),I suppose there's a first time for everything.
08x19,Unknown,Go ahead. My son.
08x19,Unknown,(majestic theme playing)
08x19,Unknown,Okay.
08x19,Unknown,"Yeah, all right."
08x19,Unknown,Are you guys sure we're gonna like this
08x19,Unknown,Woodworthy Manor
08x19,Unknown,show?
08x19,Unknown,"Yeah, it sounds kind of boring."
08x19,Unknown,(gasping)
08x19,Unknown,Kind of boring?
08x19,Unknown,"Grab a seat guys, but trust me, you're only gonna need the edge."
08x19,Unknown,(concerto plays)
08x19,Unknown,"Ah-ha, all right, now, a little backstory."
08x19,Unknown,Lady Stoutshire has developed a serious case of croquet ankle and the cook Mrs. Bootbrush can't find enough chestnuts for a proper St. Crispin's Day goose.
08x19,Unknown,Let's watch.
08x19,Unknown,I love you.
08x19,Unknown,My wrist is broken.

08x20,Unknown,"Kids, in April of 2013, your mother and I were very close and yet very far apart."
08x20,Unknown,I was living on West 82nd Street.
08x20,Unknown,She was up on West 115th.
08x20,Unknown,She was getting a degree in economics.
08x20,Unknown,I was teaching architecture.
08x20,Unknown,I was always at MacLaren's.
08x20,Unknown,She was always... not spending all her time in a bar.
08x20,Unknown,She was dating some finance guy named Louis.
08x20,Unknown,And I...
08x20,Unknown,I was alone.
08x20,Unknown,"Ted, get ready to be surrounded by half-naked, grease-covered bodies."
08x20,Unknown,"And by grease, I mean motor grease."

08x20,Unknown,Forget everything you remember about

08x20,Unknown,Think I'm gonna take it easy tonight.
08x20,Unknown,"Ted, trust me,"
08x20,Unknown,"20 years from now, you'll be glad you saw"
08x20,Robots vs. Wrestlers,Legends.
08x20,Unknown,I can't imagine a world where that's possible.
08x20,Unknown,I'm serious.
08x20,Unknown,"20 years from now, when my 26-year-old third wife asks me about this..."
08x20,Unknown,You make a lot of those jokes.
08x20,Unknown,"I'm gonna say, ""Yeah, it was awesome, but you know the funny thing?"
08x20,Unknown,"Ted almost didn't go."" Hmm."
08x20,Unknown,"""But thank God he did, because it was a great night."""
08x20,Unknown,"And then she and I will adjourn to the Jacuzzi, where my fourth wife will be waiting for us, already warming herself up on the jets."
08x20,Unknown,"Oh, Robin's here--"
08x20,Unknown,I'll tell you the rest later.
08x20,Unknown,"Please do, that story could go anywhere."
08x20,Unknown,Mwah.
08x20,Unknown,"Hey, hello. Hey."
08x20,Unknown,Here we are at the bar once more.
08x20,Unknown,"""What will I have to drink?"" you ask."
08x20,Unknown,Hmm.
08x20,Unknown,Minnesota Tidal Wave.
08x20,Unknown,"""What's that?"" you ask."
08x20,Unknown,Only the best cocktail ever.
08x20,Unknown,"""Who invented it?"" you ask."
08x20,Unknown,Me.
08x20,Unknown,And it's not a girly drink.
08x20,Unknown,"Lily, why would you even say that?"
08x20,(scoffing),Girly drink.
08x20,Unknown,"Hey, I am the least girly girl on Earth, and I love the Minnesota Tidal Wave."
08x20,Unknown,"Thank you, Robin."
08x20,Unknown,"Matter of fact, I'm going to go order one right now with my head held high."
08x20,Unknown,Lily.
08x20,Unknown,You want me to order it for you?
08x20,Unknown,"Yes, please, thank you, baby."
08x20,Unknown,"Ted, let me tell you the secret to life."
08x20,Unknown,Hmm.

08x20,Unknown,I don't know.
08x20,Unknown,Let's ask him.
08x20,Unknown,"Close your eyes, Ted."
08x20,Unknown,(sighs)
08x20,Unknown,"Okay, now open them."
08x20,Unknown,"Barney, I swear to God, if I open my eyes and your bare ass is an inch away from my face again..."
08x20,Unknown,Just open your eyes.

08x20,Unknown,...at first.
08x20,Unknown,"But then you're gonna drink way too much, hence the headache."
08x20,Unknown,"Then you're gonna jump into the ring and sprain your wrist, hence the splint."
08x20,Unknown,"And then afterwards, you're gonna smoke half a pack of cigarettes, hence the..."
08x20,Unknown,(coughing)
08x20,Unknown,"Well, that's the sound a good time."
08x20,Unknown,"And 20 hours from now, when you're me, you're gonna want to come back here, right to this very spot, right now, and smack yourself upside the head."
08x20,Unknown,"Yeah, but obviously I wouldn't do that 'cause I'd only be smacking myself--"
08x20,Unknown,Ow!
08x20,Unknown,"Don't do this to me, Ted. Don't do this to us."
08x20,Unknown,"Don't listen to yourself, Present-Day-Ted."

08x20,"20-Hours-From-Now-Me, just tell me one thing",do I hurl?
08x20,Unknown,"Yeah, kid."
08x20,Unknown,You hurl.
08x20,Unknown,A lot?

08x20,"Okay, how about this",we go to
08x20,Unknown,"Robots vs. Wrestlers,"
08x20,Unknown,but I don't drink too much?
08x20,Unknown,Interesting.
08x20,Unknown,I'm good with that.
08x20,Unknown,"No, forget it."
08x20,Unknown,"If Ted doesn't get wasted, there's no way he'll end up making out with that surprisingly realistic-looking female robot."
08x20,Unknown,"Wait, I kiss a female robot?"
08x20,Unknown,"Oh, you do a lot more than that."
08x20,Unknown,"Now, look, nobody is saying you need alcohol to have an exciting and memorable night."
08x20,Unknown,(all agreeing) Absolutely not. Absolutely not.
08x20,Unknown,"But in this case, yeah, you kind of have to be wasted."
08x20,Unknown,"(all agreeing, overlapping chatter)"
08x20,Unknown,You drink beers in cans still.
08x20,Unknown,It makes the robot scarier.
08x20,Unknown,They named my drink after her.
08x20,Unknown,The Minnesota Tidal Wave.
08x20,Unknown,It's my usual.
08x20,Unknown,Immaterial!
08x20,Unknown,"If it's gonna be named after anybody, it should be called The Marshall Eriksen."
08x20,Unknown,"Sorry, it's The Robin Scherbatsky."
08x20,Unknown,Read it and weep.
08x20,Unknown,"Oh, so you're gonna Zuckerberg me?"
08x20,Unknown,That it?
08x20,Unknown,You're Zuckerberging me?
08x20,Unknown,That's fine.
08x20,Unknown,I'll see you in court.
08x20,Unknown,Little court known as the dance floor.
08x20,Unknown,Dance-off. Now.
08x20,Unknown,"No, no dancing."
08x20,Unknown,"Marshall, we've been through this."
08x20,Unknown,The doctor said your dancer's hip is worse than ever.
08x20,Unknown,You have to lay off dancing for a while.
08x20,Unknown,"You're k*lling me, Lily!"
08x20,Unknown,You're k*lling me!
08x20,Unknown,I'm an adult.
08x20,Unknown,You have to let me dance my own battles.
08x20,Unknown,"Marshall, there's not gonna be a dance-off because the name is staying."
08x20,Unknown,"Period, end of story."
08x20,Unknown,I just like having my name on something.
08x20,Unknown,"Oh, you do?"
08x20,Unknown,"Oh, that's great, Robin."
08x20,Unknown,Then that's what you will get.
08x20,Unknown,That's... what you... will get.
08x20,Unknown,"Mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm."
08x20,Unknown,"Oh, hey, Robin."
08x20,Unknown,"You here ""for a good time""?"
08x20,(whispers),Classic.
08x20,Unknown,Did you write my number in the men's room?
08x20,Unknown,It... (scoffs)
08x20,Unknown,"Well, I don't know."
08x20,Unknown,"I guess you'll never know unless you go in there, which I highly doubt that..."
08x20,Unknown,There she goes.
08x20,Unknown,"Okay, boys."
08x20,Unknown,Close your eyes and zip your flies.
08x20,Unknown,Hi. Don't mind me.
08x20,Unknown,I don't think you should have done that.
08x20,Unknown,"Lily, I know what I'm doing, all right?"
08x20,Unknown,I'm a lawyer.
08x20,Unknown,I've thought about every possible scenario.
08x20,Unknown,I'm ten steps ahead of...
08x20,Unknown,Where's she going?
08x20,Unknown,Probably into the ladies' room to write something on the wall about you.
08x20,Unknown,Nobody writes things on the walls of the ladies' room.
08x20,Unknown,Have you been in the ladies' room?
08x20,Unknown,Of course not.
08x20,Unknown,"Lily, I know that I have the sexual charisma of a bad boy, but I certainly don't have the manners of one."
08x20,Unknown,What'd you write in there?
08x20,Unknown,Why don't you go in and look?
08x20,Unknown,"You know I can't do that, Robin."
08x20,Unknown,"Lily, can you go look?"
08x20,Unknown,"Oh, I thought you wanted to dance your own battles."
08x20,Unknown,"Ladies, put your blouses back on!"
08x20,Unknown,I'm coming in!
08x20,Unknown,Robin
08x20,Unknown,"Dear Marshall, I know this is a strange way to apologize, but I'm sorry I let Carl name your drink after me."
08x20,Unknown,Why didn't I say something?
08x20,Unknown,"Gosh, I guess that goes back to my childhood."
08x20,Unknown,"Okay, guys."
08x20,Unknown,Let's go to
08x20,Unknown,Robots vs. Wrestlers.
08x20,Unknown,Huzzah! Now you're talking!
08x20,Unknown,Here we go.
08x20,Unknown,"Nope, sit down."

08x20,Unknown,"What's the stain on your shirt, bro?"
08x20,Unknown,"Please, please, I really do have something very important to..."
08x20,Unknown,(Barney laughs mockingly)
08x20,Unknown,You look stupid.
08x20,Unknown,Here's your spaghetti.
08x20,Unknown,And be careful...
08x20,Unknown,...with the meatball.
08x20,Unknown,Robin
08x20,Unknown,And that's the only time my father ever said he was proud of me.
08x20,Unknown,Maybe that's why I stole credit for your drink.
08x20,Unknown,Maybe that's why I needed to pour my heart out like this.
08x20,Unknown,"Or, maybe I wrote this so you'd be in here long enough for a lady to walk in, causing you to freak out and hide in the stall."
08x20,Unknown,(door opens)
08x20,Unknown,"So, you got a text message? Yeah."
08x20,Unknown,Whoa.
08x20,Unknown,Try to get some in your mouth next time.
08x20,20-MINUTES-FROM-NOW-BARNEY,"Okay, everybody, listen up."
08x20,Unknown,"When I walked in here, I was 20-Minutes-"
08x20,Unknown,From-Now-Barney.
08x20,Unknown,But that was 19 minutes and some serious acid reflux--
08x20,Unknown,who orders spaghetti at an Irish bar?-- ago.
08x20,Unknown,"Now, I'm 20-Seconds-"
08x20,Unknown,"From-Now-Barney, and I'm telling you, watch that door."
08x20,Unknown,Why?
08x20,Unknown,That's why.
08x20,Unknown,"Um, oh."
08x20,Unknown,"In-in, like,"
08x20,Unknown,12 seconds.
08x20,Unknown,Your skin looks great.
08x20,Unknown,Thanks.
08x20,Unknown,And thank you for taking such good care of it.
08x20,Unknown,Shh.
08x20,Unknown,That's why.
08x20,Unknown,Who is that?
08x20,Unknown,All
08x20,,She's the coat check girl from that dance club we went to seven years ago.
08x20,20-YEARS-FROM-NOW-TED,You remember that night.
08x20,Unknown,When Barney grinded with his cousin.
08x20,Unknown,"Oh, man, you remember that"
08x20,Unknown,20 years from now?
08x20,Unknown,He won't let anyone forget.
08x20,Unknown,Ted
08x20,,Coat check girl.
08x20,Unknown,"I always meant to go back to that club and get her number, but I didn't."
08x20,Unknown,And now she's here?
08x20,Unknown,She's in this bar seven years later?
08x20,Unknown,I-I can't believe this.
08x20,Unknown,"So, wait, do you guys think I should go talk to her?"
08x20,Unknown,"Are you kidding me? Yes, go..."
08x20,Unknown,How many different ways... Idiot.
08x20,(high-pitched voice),Hello?
08x20,Unknown,Is anybody out there?
08x20,(whispers),Sounds like the coast is clear.
08x20,Unknown,(women screaming)
08x20,Unknown,"No, no, wait!"
08x20,Unknown,"Please, it's not my fault!"
08x20,Unknown,I was tricked!
08x20,Unknown,"Not cool, Marshall."
08x20,Unknown,This is a nice bar.
08x20,Unknown,"Girls come here, they just want to relax with their friends, maybe have a few Robin Scherbatskys, and not have to worry out some guy pulling a Marshall Eriksen in the bathroom."
08x20,Unknown,"No, no, no, I know. I just..."
08x20,Unknown,"Wait a minute, did you just use my name as shorthand for a guy being creepy?"
08x20,Unknown,Yep.
08x20,Unknown,"Well, you know what, Carl?"
08x20,Unknown,I think that you are making a broad and prejudicial assumption.
08x20,Unknown,"So next time I meet a guy who just goes around rushing to judgment, I'm gonna say, ""Hey, that guy's being a real Carl..."""
08x20,Unknown,You don't know my last name.
08x20,Unknown,"You've been drinking here for years, and you don't know my last name."
08x20,Unknown,I will name every drink in this bar after you if you can tell me my last name.
08x20,Unknown,"Well, that just seems confusing."
08x20,Unknown,How will you know what people are ordering?
08x20,Unknown,"What's my last name, Marshall?"
08x20,Unknown,It's Carl...
08x20,Unknown,...'s Junior.
08x20,Unknown,"Okay, wish me luck, everyone."
08x20,Unknown,Break a leg...
08x20,Unknown,(everyone talking at once)
08x20,Unknown,(clears throat)
08x20,Unknown,What the hell?
08x20,Unknown,Do not talk to her.
08x20,Unknown,What-what... Who are you?
08x20,Unknown,We are 20-Months-From-Now-
08x20,Unknown,Coat-Check-Girl.
08x20,Unknown,But there's two of you.
08x20,Unknown,"Right, because if you go over there and you talk to her,"
08x20,Unknown,"20 months from now, it's gonna end in one of two ways."
08x20,Unknown,Either you are gonna get sick of me.
08x20,I made you muffins because of your nickname,Muffin.
08x20,Unknown,Or...
08x20,Unknown,I am gonna get sick of you and your stupid habits.
08x20,Unknown,Stop DVR-ing the news. You're never gonna catch up.
08x20,(sobbing),"Oh, stop it, you're scaring him off."
08x20,Unknown,"By the way, I'm pregnant."
08x20,Unknown,"No, she's not."
08x20,Unknown,"Okay, no, I'm not, but that made you happy for a second, right?"
08x20,Unknown,"Please shut up. Okay, wait, so you're saying it's doomed completely?"
08x20,Unknown,One of us is just guaranteed to get sick of the other and call it quits?
08x20,Unknown,"You've been dating for a long time, Ted."
08x20,Unknown,Has it ever gone any other way?
08x20,Unknown,(quiet chatter)
08x20,Unknown,Look at this one.
08x20,Unknown,Robin
08x20,,Thank you so much.
08x20,Unknown,Hey.
08x20,Unknown,"Hey, you look kind of down."
08x20,Unknown,"Have a Robin Scherbatsky, on me."
08x20,Unknown,None of this would have happened if Lily had let me dance.
08x20,Unknown,(sighs)
08x20,Unknown,"Baby, wait."
08x20,Unknown,"God, you're still clinging to that?"
08x20,Unknown,"Marshall, it doesn't matter, 'cause you'd lose anyway, and you know why?"
08x20,Unknown,"'Cause I'm Sparkles, b*tch."
08x20,Unknown,"Oh, and you think you can step to me?"
08x20,Unknown,You think you can step up to the streets?
08x20,Unknown,To me?
08x20,Unknown,You think you can step up over me to the streets?
08x20,Unknown,I guess we'll never know because you are not allowed...
08x20,Unknown,"Wait, wait."

08x20,Unknown,"Ted, this moment already is gone."
08x20,Unknown,The whole Minnesota Tidal Wave thing happened five years ago.
08x20,Unknown,It's just a memory.
08x20,Unknown,And the rest of this never happened.
08x20,Unknown,"Right now, Marshall and Lily are upstairs, trying to get Marvin to go back to sleep."
08x20,Unknown,Robin and I are trying to decide on a caterer.

08x20,Unknown,Robots vs. Wrestlers.
08x20,Unknown,"No, I'd go home."
08x20,Unknown,"I'd go to my old apartment, see all my old furniture, my old stuff."
08x20,Unknown,"I'd see my old drafting table, where I sketched out my first building."
08x20,Unknown,I'd sit on that old couch and smell the Indian food cooking three stories below.
08x20,Unknown,"I'd go to Lily and Marshall's place, be back in that old living room where so many things happened."
08x20,Unknown,I'd see the baby.
08x20,Unknown,"I don't know if you can picture me holding your six-foot-seven cousin Marvin over my head, but back then I could."
08x20,Unknown,"I'd go have a drink with Barney and Robin, watch them fight about their caterer or whatever it was they were fighting about that night."
08x20,Unknown,But none of those things is the thing I'd do first.
08x20,Unknown,You know the thing I'd do first?

08x21,Unknown,It's only for a year. Carry on.
08x21,Unknown,But I'm married and we have a baby and they just opened a Shake Shack on our block and there's never a line!
08x21,Unknown,I understand it's a big decision.

08x21,Unknown,"Why do people go to a bar, anyway?"
08x21,Unknown,To get your drink on and some girl's pants off.
08x21,Unknown,I can do both at home.
08x21,Unknown,What are you looking at?
08x21,Unknown,The girl in the big coat?
08x21,Unknown,We were in the same yoga class together.
08x21,Unknown,You know how sometimes you'll meet a girl and there'll be that one bewitching little detail that'll make you fall in love with her instantly?

08x21,Unknown,"Just promise you film it, and please use a tripod."
08x21,Unknown,There's nothing artistic about shaky-cam.
08x21,Unknown,It just looks sloppy.
08x21,Unknown,He wants me to move to Rome for a year to buy art for him.
08x21,Unknown,Whoa! Seriously?
08x21,Unknown,Is that something you want to do? Are you kidding?

08x21,Unknown,He really loves his job here.
08x21,Unknown,"Yeah, but he also loves Italy!"
08x21,Unknown,"He took a week of Italian in college, and the only reason he dropped it was 'cause he had a conflict... with being not stoned."
08x21,Unknown,"But he still knows how to say the phrase, ""Come on, bro, don't Bogart all the Funyuns."""

08x21,Unknown,"Yes, I'm engaged to the coolest girl on Earth."
08x21,Unknown,"This is about looking, not touching."
08x21,Unknown,Robin understands there is one set of balls she can't tie up with a necktie and lightly hit with a Ping-Pong paddle.
08x21,Unknown,These balls.
08x21,Unknown,"Okay, I'm gonna call The Captain, get this over with."

08x21,Unknown,Ahoy.
08x21,Unknown,"Hello, Captain?"
08x21,Unknown,"Lily, I hope you're not calling to harpoon our big move to Rome."
08x21,Unknown,"Thank you, but I can't ask my husband to abandon his career."
08x21,Unknown,Would you like me to try and convince him?
08x21,Unknown,I'm very persuasive.
08x21,Unknown,"I'm sorry, the ship has sailed."
08x21,Unknown,What's that mean?
08x21,Unknown,"Well, you know, ""The ship has sailed""?"
08x21,Unknown,That it's over and there's nothing you can do?
08x21,Unknown,What a peculiar expression. Hmm.

08x21,Unknown,"A scarf?! No, don't put on, take off!"
08x21,Unknown,"Okay, you're starting to drool."
08x21,Unknown,I'm calling creepy.
08x21,Unknown,"Lily, it's fine."
08x21,Unknown,This is purely academic.
08x21,Unknown,It's-It's like bird-watching.
08x21,Unknown,"And right now, I am watching a double-breasted-- Robin!"
08x21,Unknown,Wait-- they know each other?!
08x21,Unknown,"Whoa, wait--"
08x21,Unknown,what is going on here?
08x21,Unknown,"Oh, my God, it's happening."
08x21,Unknown,This is just like I imagined.
08x21,Unknown,"Right in front of Ted, so I can rub it in his face."
08x21,Unknown,The belt is mine!
08x21,Unknown,"Hi, guys. Barney, you remember Liddy."
08x21,Unknown,I do?
08x21,Unknown,Yes! Libby.
08x21,Unknown,Liddy. We met when Robin hired me.
08x21,Unknown,Robin hired you?
08x21,Unknown,Naughty girl. Okay.
08x21,Unknown,"Okay, so how's this gonna go down?"
08x21,Unknown,"You two just gonna start, and I'll just jump in?"
08x21,Unknown,"Uh, she's our wedding planner."
08x21,Unknown,Of course she's the wedding planner!
08x21,Unknown,"Good to see you again, Libby."
08x21,Unknown,Liddy. Yeah.
08x21,Unknown,"Hey, I'm Ted. We, uh, we met once before."
08x21,Unknown,"Oh, right, in yoga class. How are you?"
08x21,Unknown,She's talking to me.
08x21,Unknown,"Well, I would love to stay, but now that I'm unemployed, I think I'll go surprise Marshall at work."
08x21,Unknown,(sighs)
08x21,Unknown,Wedding planner.
08x21,Unknown,Narrator
08x21,Unknown,"So Lily went to visit Marshall at work, hoping she wasn't interrupting anything important."
08x21,Unknown,She wasn't.
08x21,Unknown,Whoa. What is going on?
08x21,Unknown,"Bernard, if we just glue the cards together..."
08x21,Unknown,Lily! What are you doing here?
08x21,Unknown,"Well, I baked you brownies because I thought you were busy working, but... so when you said..."
08x21,Unknown,"Lily, hey, I can't really talk."
08x21,Unknown,I'm working on a big project right now.
08x21,Unknown,It's a real house of cards.
08x21,Unknown,"Is this the ""house of cards"" you were talking about?"
08x21,Unknown,I thought you had some big client.
08x21,Unknown,"Oh, sweetheart, we haven't had a client here in months."
08x21,Unknown,Mmm! Brownies! Hey!
08x21,Unknown,What is going on? What do you mean you haven't had a client in months?
08x21,Unknown,"Ever since the Gruber case, we lost a lot of business, people got laid off... it's just me and Bernard now."
08x21,Unknown,Where's Cootes?
08x21,Unknown,"He's holed up in a b*mb shelter in Colorado, waiting for the apocalypse and tending to his herb garden."
08x21,Unknown,"So all those times I've called you in the past few months, when you talked about how busy you were... you were just lying to me?"
08x21,Unknown,"Technically, I never lied..."
08x21,Unknown,"Hey, baby."
08x21,Unknown,"Hey, baby, I can't talk right now."

08x21,Unknown,I got to focus on the client.
08x21,Unknown,Gotta go. Bye.
08x21,Unknown,Where were we?
08x21,Unknown,Chapter 19.
08x21,Unknown,I can't talk right now; I got a lot on my plate.
08x21,Unknown,"Well, let's dig in."
08x21,Unknown,"If we start now, we can be done by lunch."
08x21,Unknown,"Now's not a good time, Lil."
08x21,Unknown,We got a lot of balls in the air right now.
08x21,Unknown,"Okay, toss me the stapler."
08x21,Unknown,Unbelievable.
08x21,Unknown,Wait-- when you said you were about to get reamed...
08x21,Unknown,"Oh, right. That."
08x21,Unknown,"No, sometimes, for fun, We throw reams of paper at each other."
08x21,Unknown,Bernard! Not a good time!
08x21,Unknown,Read the room!
08x21,Unknown,"I'm sorry, baby, I..."
08x21,Unknown,I didn't want you to see me fail.
08x21,Unknown,Damn it! Do you realize what you cost us by lying to me?
08x21,Unknown,"The Captain is moving to Rome, and he offered to bring me along as his art consultant, but I turned it down, because I thought you loved your job."
08x21,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh."
08x21,Unknown,"If we lived in Italy, I could just spend my days taking care of Marvin and trying to make pasta and watching Italian"
08x21,Unknown,Price Is Right.
08x21,Unknown,It sounds like a dream!
08x21,Unknown,"Oh, it's too late."
08x21,Unknown,"No, no. Lily, I'm going to The Captain's right now!"
08x21,Unknown,I'm gonna make this right!
08x21,Unknown,I'm gonna get you that job!
08x21,Unknown,"No, Marshall... You're getting that job!"
08x21,Unknown,You can just make it out to Liddy Gates.
08x21,Unknown,That's L-I-D-D-Y.
08x21,Unknown,"L-I, two D's... double D... two D's... -Y."
08x21,Unknown,"Well, here is the final menu, as we discussed, but let me be clear."
08x21,Unknown,You're the boss; I'm here to serve you.
08x21,Unknown,"So if there's anything you want me to remove, just tell me to remove it and it's gone."
08x21,Unknown,I'll remove anything you want.
08x21,Unknown,"That sounds like a sound policy. Up to you, whatever you feel like."
08x21,Unknown,That's a good... That's a good thing to know.
08x21,Unknown,"That's fine, you can remove whatever you want."
08x21,Unknown,"I'm serious, and I won't be offended; you want it gone, I'll take it right off. Is it hot in here?"
08x21,Unknown,It's not cold. You know what?
08x21,Unknown,"It's hot; it's sticky. It's not... It's like Bikram, right?"
08x21,Unknown,We're yoga buddies.
08x21,Unknown,♪ Yoga buddies.
08x21,Unknown,"Well, I'll let you guys read the menu."
08x21,Can you point me to the... GUYS,Coat rack?
08x21,Unknown,...restroom?
08x21,Unknown,"Uh, it's right over there."
08x21,Unknown,But it's hard to pee in a giant coat.
08x21,Unknown,"Okay, what's going on?"
08x21,Unknown,Why are you guys being so weird?
08x21,Unknown,"Ted says that Liddy has a ridonkulous body, but there's no way of verifying because she won't take off the coat!"
08x21,Unknown,Is that why it's so hot in here?
08x21,Unknown,Did you pay Carl to turn up the heat again?
08x21,Unknown,"Well, yes."
08x21,Unknown,But I was curious.
08x21,Unknown,I want to get that coat on the rack so I can see the rack that's under the coat.
08x21,Unknown,My God.
08x21,Unknown,I have been wondering the same thing.
08x21,Unknown,"I mean, she never takes that coat off."
08x21,Unknown,Whatever she's smuggling under there has to be thermonuclear.
08x21,Unknown,I bet she has WBDs.
08x21,Unknown,Weapons of bra destruction.
08x21,Unknown,Thank you.
08x21,Unknown,"This, this is why you're the coolest fiancée ever."
08x21,Unknown,"(both moan, laugh)"
08x21,Unknown,"So, Ted, when you say ridonkulous..."
08x21,Unknown,I can't even describe it.
08x21,Unknown,It'd be like trying to explain a rainbow to a blind person.
08x21,Unknown,Is she single?
08x21,Unknown,Why don't you ask her out?
08x21,Unknown,"Actually, I almost did the first time we met, before she took off that coat."
08x21,Unknown,Sandstorm?
08x21,Unknown,Dubai? That hoodie?
08x21,Unknown,"I mean, it's ridonkulous."
08x21,Unknown,"Oh, I know. I so want to see it again."
08x21,Unknown,"Well, hey, I mean, maybe after this, if you're not doing anything."
08x21,Unknown,"Totally, and maybe later, we could get a bite to eat."
08x21,Unknown,There's this great place that's super close.
08x21,Unknown,"No, I..."
08x21,Unknown,"No, I... No."
08x21,Unknown,It was just too much.
08x21,Unknown,Indiana Jones wouldn't look at this body.
08x21,Unknown,This is a body that would melt a n*zi's face.
08x21,Unknown,"Oh, man, I want my face to melt."
08x21,Unknown,(sighs) It's too bad Marshall isn't here.
08x21,Unknown,Why Marshall?
08x21,Unknown,'Cause he could just say...
08x21,Unknown,"Hey, Liddy, why don't you take off that coat?"
08x21,Unknown,Barney
08x21,Unknown,And Liddy would be all...
08x21,Unknown,"Sure, should I take my shirt off, too?"
08x21,Unknown,"No, the coat's probably enough."
08x21,Unknown,And he'd get away with it.
08x21,Unknown,You know why? No stink.
08x21,Unknown,You obviously haven't split a cab with him after basketball.
08x21,Unknown,"No, I don't mean ""physical stink."""
08x21,Unknown,I mean the pheromonal stink a guy gives off when he's desperate for action to a pathetic degree.
08x21,Unknown,"You know, like Ted."
08x21,Unknown,I have stink?
08x21,Unknown,"Bro, you dipped in stink."
08x21,Unknown,If Liddy came back to the table and you said...
08x21,Unknown,"Uh, Liddy, why don't you, uh, take off that coat?"
08x21,Unknown,You want me to take my coat off?
08x21,Unknown,"How about instead, I take off your face?"
08x21,Unknown,Ow!
08x21,Unknown,"Ow, oh!"
08x21,Unknown,Ted
08x21,Unknown,Really?
08x21,Unknown,You had to have her beat me up?
08x21,Unknown,"She's not done, Ted."
08x21,Unknown,Ghost Protocol
08x21,Unknown,wasn't that good!
08x21,Unknown,(screams)
08x21,Unknown,"Marshall, on the other hand, girls take one look and just know there's a guy who's met the girl of his dreams and wants to spend the rest of his life with her and only her."
08x21,Unknown,So why don't you ask her?
08x21,Unknown,Pardon me?
08x21,Unknown,Aren't you a guy who's met the girl of his dreams and wants to spend the rest of his life with her and only her?
08x21,Unknown,"Of course, baby."
08x21,Unknown,So why don't you ask her to take her coat off?
08x21,Unknown,Um...
08x21,Unknown,And you never even saw
08x21,Unknown,Ghost Protocol.
08x21,Unknown,"So, the big day's coming up."
08x21,Unknown,How are you guys feeling?
08x21,Unknown,"I talked to the caterer, and the mini lamb shanks are gonna be amazing."
08x21,Unknown,"Okay, Barney. You can do this."
08x21,Unknown,Just say it. Say it.
08x21,Unknown,...little ones and big ones...
08x21,Unknown,Say it.
08x21,Unknown,"Hey, Liddy, do you want to take off your coat?"
08x21,Unknown,Sure.
08x21,Unknown,(whimpers)
08x21,Unknown,I did it! I proved to myself and everyone else that I have no desire to be with any other woman.
08x21,Unknown,I am completely immune to every other...
08x21,Unknown,Holy crap!
08x21,Unknown,(both panting)
08x21,Unknown,"And it was, indeed, ridonkulous."
08x21,Unknown,"And we got to see it, all thanks to this lovely lady right here."
08x21,Unknown,"Robin, thanks to you, I can now walk up to any girl and say whatever creepy, disgusting thing I want and totally get away with it."
08x21,Unknown,Mm. Man!
08x21,Unknown,I think I'm gonna like being married.
08x21,Unknown,(phone rings)
08x21,Unknown,Hello?
08x21,Unknown,Ahoy.
08x21,Unknown,"Ahoy, Lily."
08x21,Unknown,I just had a long talk with your husband.
08x21,Unknown,He convinced me to offer you that job in Rome again.
08x21,Unknown,How do you respond?
08x21,Unknown,"Thanks, but the answer is still no."
08x21,Unknown,"Lily, why the hell did you turn that down again."
08x21,Unknown,Because I 'd have to get a new passport photo.
08x21,Unknown,And I'd miss out on New York in August.
08x21,Unknown,Unless they open the Shake Shop in a box.
08x21,Unknown,"Lily, what's the real reason?"
08x21,Unknown,What if we moved to Rome...
08x21,Unknown,(laughing)
08x21,Unknown,What's so funny?
08x21,Unknown,I'm uh sorry.
08x21,Unknown,I can't believe you paid a
08x21,Unknown,10 million euro this painting.
08x21,Unknown,Why not?
08x21,Unknown,This is not even a painting.
08x21,Unknown,"I spin my plate, it's gonna fill a blank canvas."
08x21,Unknown,It's like a toilet.
08x21,Unknown,It just make you look uh stupida.
08x21,Unknown,"Lily, you're fired. What?"
08x21,Unknown,But no. I-I...it's still a great painting.
08x21,Unknown,I like what it says about the structure in society and the changing worlds of women.
08x21,Unknown,(speaks Italian)
08x21,Unknown,I used to be an art consultant.
08x21,Unknown,"Hey baby. It's time for Marvin's, uh, bottle."
08x21,Unknown,And it's all because I screwed up and through away a perfectly comfortable life here in New York.
08x21,Unknown,"Lily, you're not going to screw up."
08x21,Unknown,"You know what, just please, just leave it alone."
08x21,Unknown,"Besides, deep down, I don't think Marshall's even excited about Italy."
08x21,Unknown,Narrator
08x21,Unknown,At that very moment in little Italy.
08x21,Unknown,(phone chirps)
08x21,Unknown,Marron!
08x21,Unknown,I can't wait for my wedding day.
08x21,Unknown,"I mean, there is no way that Liddy is gonna be wearing that coat, right?"
08x21,Unknown,Right?
08x21,Unknown,"""Barney Stinson, do you hope she wears something slinky and backless?"""
08x21,Unknown,"""I do."""
08x21,Unknown,"Okay, can I just say something as your best man?"
08x21,Unknown,Be careful.
08x21,Unknown,What do you mean?
08x21,Unknown,"You just... you haven't been acting like a guy who's about to get married, and I know you think it's okay because Robin's so cool, but I'm telling you, she's not as cool as you think she is."
08x21,Unknown,"Oh, I see."
08x21,Unknown,And you'd know this because you know Robin better than I do.
08x21,Unknown,You know what she appreciates better than her own fiancé.
08x21,Unknown,"I'm just saying, if I was getting married in three weeks..."
08x21,Unknown,"But you're not getting married in three weeks, Ted."
08x21,Unknown,I am.
08x21,Unknown,"Robin's marrying me, not you."
08x21,Unknown,You're right.
08x21,Unknown,Not my place.
08x21,Unknown,Why don't I get the next round?
08x21,Unknown,So... how many times are you gonna say no to your dream job?
08x21,Unknown,I'm just trying to plan my day.
08x21,Unknown,"I'm a scaredy-cat, okay?"
08x21,Unknown,"I want to be the type of person that just charges fearlessly into the unknown, but I came back two weeks early from Paris because I was lonely."
08x21,Unknown,"I went to San Francisco, and I was never more depressed in my life."
08x21,Unknown,"I'm small town, Marshall."
08x21,Unknown,I'm a hick from Brooklyn who's terrified of living more than ten subway stops from where I was born.
08x21,Unknown,"Okay, Lily, if I can move from St. Cloud, Minnesota, to New York City, then you can move to Rome."
08x21,Unknown,We know nothing about Italy.
08x21,Unknown,We have no friends there.
08x21,Unknown,We don't speak the language.
08x21,Unknown,"Okay, so you know that one sentence."
08x21,Unknown,Can you say anything else?
08x21,Unknown,That-that was the same sentence.
08x21,Unknown,You just changed the inflection.
08x21,Unknown,"I love you, too."
08x21,Unknown,All right.
08x21,Unknown,We're going to Italy.
08x21,Unknown,Si!
08x21,Unknown,"You may not know this yet, but, um, I've already done some shopping."
08x21,Unknown,Welcome home.
08x21,Unknown,"Oh... You are so cool, but not for long."
08x22,Unknown,Narrator
08x22,Unknown,"Kids, this is the story of the night Barney's life completely fell apart."
08x22,Unknown,"My life is finally perfect, and that is never going to change."
08x22,Unknown,Fired up for dinner with my mom tonight?
08x22,Unknown,"Yeah. To help streamline the rest of our lives, you can always assume my answer to that question is no."
08x22,Unknown,W... I'm pretty nervous.
08x22,Unknown,"Nervous? Why? It's just gonna be two hours of ""I love Barney the most."" ""No, I love Barney the most."""
08x22,Unknown,You're right. I may not even get a chance to talk.
08x22,Unknown,But I'm still--
08x22,Unknown,I-I don't know. I'm worried she won't think I'm good enough to be engaged to her precious little Love-Love.
08x22,Unknown,"Okay, first of all, it's ""Wuv-Wuv."""
08x22,Unknown,"And second, don't worry."
08x22,Unknown,"I'm just gonna drop off our catering deposit, and then I will be there for you. Mm."
08x22,Unknown,"Okay, well, please don't be late."
08x22,Unknown,I am counting on you tonight.
08x22,Unknown,And be careful--
08x22,Unknown,"that's 5,000 bucks in there."
08x22,Unknown,"Uh, I think I'll be okay walking four blocks here on the Upper East Side."
08x22,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x22,Unknown,(grunting)
08x22,Unknown,"Please, I swear I never talked to the North Koreans!"
08x22,Unknown,"Unless you are the North Koreans, in which case I never talked to the South Koreans!"
08x22,MAN (menacingly),"Barney Stinson, you are being kidnapped."

08x22,Unknown,Sorry. You two are on your own.
08x22,Unknown,And you will disappoint me.
08x22,Unknown,"But make it great, okay?"
08x22,Unknown,But this is a strong start.
08x22,Unknown,The students have become... the intermediate students.

08x22,Unknown,"Hi, Momsies."
08x22,Unknown,"I forgot, I'm mentoring an underprivileged child tonight, and Robin can't stand the idea of dinner with you by herself, so we're not gonna be able to..."
08x22,Unknown,Don't bother. She's already here.

08x22,Unknown,Robin? Too late. She's already there.

08x22,Unknown,Robin can't stand the idea of dinner with me?
08x22,Unknown,Great! We're all set then.

08x22,Unknown,"Well, you know the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City?"
08x22,Unknown,Yeah.
08x22,Unknown,You know the secret penthouse in the top of the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City?
08x22,Unknown,Yeah!

08x22,Unknown,Visible from our window.
08x22,Unknown,In the distance.
08x22,Unknown,Behind the refinery.

08x22,Unknown,Why are we outside Atlantic City?
08x22,Unknown,"Well, we thought it was best, what with your weakness for games of chance."

08x22,Unknown,"Kids, Barney was addicted to one Chinese gambling game that was, well, sort of complicated."

08x22,Unknown,Why would you tell her I'm a virgin?

08x22,Unknown,"Oh, see, I thought you meant fun-crazy."
08x22,Unknown,"Shut it, Ralph Macchio."
08x22,Unknown,Why don't you go have a party with Luke Skywalker and Harry Potter and w*r Horse and all the other movie bad guys and stop ruining mine!
08x22,Unknown,This night has been catastrophic.
08x22,Unknown,"""Catastrophic""! Everybody pound."
08x22,Unknown,"Sorry, bro."
08x22,Unknown,I'm staying.
08x22,Unknown,If this is anything like my bachelor party--
08x22,Unknown,"strippers, booze, definitely no hand stuff--"
08x22,Unknown,wink-wink--
08x22,Unknown,it is gonna be in--
08x22,Unknown,wait for it-- credible.
08x22,Unknown,Incredible!
08x22,Unknown,Ted
08x22,,Wow.
08x22,Unknown,You guys are actually a lot alike.
08x22,Unknown,"You take that back, sir!"
08x22,Unknown,I am nothing like Ralph Macchio!
08x22,Unknown,"I mean, did you guys even"
08x22,Unknown,get
08x22,Unknown,a stripper?
08x22,Unknown,Bro.
08x22,Unknown,(chuckling)
08x22,Unknown,Bro.
08x22,Unknown,Of course we got a stripper.
08x22,Unknown,Do we look like the kind of dweebs who wouldn't get a stripper?
08x22,Unknown,(scoffs)
08x22,Unknown,(knocking)
08x22,Unknown,"And as the saying goes, what happens in the sensibly-priced business hotel outside Atlantic City stays in the sensibly-priced business hotel outside Atlantic City."
08x22,Unknown,Who is it?
08x22,Unknown,Woman
08x22,,Police. We got a noise complaint from...
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, who am I kidding? I can tell it's dead in there."
08x22,Unknown,I'm the stripper!
08x22,Unknown,Barney?
08x22,Unknown,Quinn?
08x22,Unknown,"This is your bachelor party? You're engaged again, less than a year after we broke up?"
08x22,Unknown,Is it Robin?
08x22,Unknown,"Now, hold on."
08x22,Unknown,You're not the only one with questions here.
08x22,Unknown,You didn't vet the stripper?!
08x22,Unknown,"Well, I'm glad you're so happy."
08x22,Unknown,"After we broke up, I had to move out of the city, my car got totaled, and I had to go back to stripping just to pay rent."
08x22,Unknown,"It's like everywhere I look, my life is a dead-end."
08x22,Unknown,Wow.
08x22,Unknown,"I am... I'm so sorry, Quinn."
08x22,Unknown,"So, how does this work?"
08x22,Unknown,"Do you give me a private show, or does everyone...?"
08x22,Unknown,I am not stripping for you.
08x22,Unknown,"Whoa, whoa! I was promised boobs."
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, Ralph, if you want, I can..."
08x22,Unknown,Lily.
08x22,Unknown,Is that the Karate Kid?
08x22,Unknown,Yes! Yes! Yes!
08x22,Unknown,No!
08x22,Unknown,"He's a lot like Barney, huh?"
08x22,Unknown,"(gasps) You take that back, madam."
08x22,Unknown,I am nothing like Ralph Macchio!
08x22,Unknown,QUINN
08x22,,"Okay, okay."
08x22,Unknown,I'll tell you what.
08x22,Unknown,I am going to strip for everyone here except Barney.
08x22,Unknown,And I'm gonna make it dirty.
08x22,Unknown,"Yeah, um, I'm the bachelor."
08x22,Unknown,Kind of no stripping without the lap of honor.
08x22,Unknown,"Back me up, bros."
08x22,Unknown,"(people whooping, dance music playing)"
08x22,Unknown,(phone ringing)
08x22,Unknown,Marshall
08x22,,How'd you even do that?
08x22,Unknown,Ted
08x22,,"What the...?! LILY: Oh, my God, yeah!"
08x22,Unknown,"Hey, Robin."
08x22,Unknown,"Hey, sweetie, having fun at your bachelor party?"
08x22,Unknown,"No. Good, 'cause my night's been hell!"
08x22,Unknown,"And that's the inverted chimney sweep, the last of the 17 basic sexual positions."
08x22,Unknown,"Now, bondage..."
08x22,Unknown,Stop! I'm not a virgin!
08x22,Unknown,My napkin ring has seen plenty of breadsticks.
08x22,Unknown,And one baguette.
08x22,Unknown,I dated a center for the Knicks.
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, thank God you're not a prude."
08x22,Unknown,Now we can really talk.
08x22,Unknown,"Four cosmos, pronto!"
08x22,Unknown,"Now she's drunk, holding up a napkin ring and three breadsticks, and talking about her night with Crosby, Stills and Nash."
08x22,Unknown,"Waiter, can I have another breadstick?"
08x22,Unknown,And Young.
08x22,Unknown,Please come back.
08x22,Unknown,(people cheering)
08x22,Unknown,Okay.
08x22,Unknown,I'll be there soon.
08x22,Unknown,Real nice. So beautiful.
08x22,Unknown,"I think we really did it. I think we did it, you know?"
08x22,Unknown,You didn't miss a thing.
08x22,Unknown,Marshall
08x22,,"Oh, Quinn? Yeah?"
08x22,Unknown,You got a little... something.
08x22,Unknown,Oh! Oh.
08x22,Unknown,(sighs)
08x22,Unknown,"Let's head back, guys."
08x22,Unknown,This night has been completely half-assed.
08x22,Unknown,You obviously missed the strip show.
08x22,Unknown,Hey-oh!
08x22,Unknown,(horn honks)
08x22,Unknown,"Ted, this was my bachelor party."
08x22,Unknown,A man only gets two or three of these in his lifetime.
08x22,Unknown,And this is all you do for me?
08x22,Unknown,"That's it, I'm calling it."
08x22,Unknown,Who needs a ride back to the city?
08x22,Unknown,Oh.
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, guys, wait, hold on, hold on."
08x22,Unknown,Drinking.
08x22,Unknown,A shot.
08x22,Unknown,sh**ting.
08x22,Unknown,A g*n.
08x22,Unknown,"Shot, g*n."
08x22,Unknown,Shotgun?
08x22,Unknown,(sighs)
08x22,Unknown,"Man, it's crowded in here."
08x22,Unknown,"I know, it's like a clown car."
08x22,Unknown,"Well, I can make some room by grinding on Ralph's lap."
08x22,Unknown,ing!
08x22,Unknown,"I-I meant, I meant sitting."
08x22,Unknown,This is the worst bachelor party ever.
08x22,Unknown,"Man, my bachelor party was incr-- wait for it--"
08x22,Unknown,"and I hope you're hungry, 'cause the second half of this word is-- edible!"
08x22,Unknown,Incredible!
08x22,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x22,Unknown,Self-shake.
08x22,Unknown,(gasps)
08x22,Unknown,"You take that back, clown."
08x22,Unknown,I am nothing like Ralph Macchio!
08x22,Unknown,RALPH
08x22,,Yeah.
08x22,Unknown,"You've got more in common with the clown, except his suit's more expensive."
08x22,Unknown,"Hey, yo!"
08x22,Unknown,(horn honks)
08x22,Unknown,"I mean, what kind of loser has his bachelor party ten yards from A.C."
08x22,Unknown,and doesn't even gamble?
08x22,Unknown,(tires screeching)
08x22,Unknown,(screams)
08x22,Unknown,"Oh. Oh, sorry."
08x22,Unknown,Sorry. Sorry.
08x22,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x22,Unknown,Sorry.
08x22,Unknown,"Oh... oh, wait."
08x22,Unknown,Just a little more.
08x22,Unknown,"Okay, sorry."
08x22,(sighs),Okay.
08x22,Unknown,(speaking Chinese)
08x22,Unknown,...bro mitzvah!
08x22,Unknown,(laughs)
08x22,Unknown,Narrator
08x22,Unknown,"Kids, I'll skip over the gambling."
08x22,Unknown,"Like I said, it was a complicated game."
08x22,Unknown,Although your old man did pick it up pretty quickly.
08x22,Unknown,(crowd cheers)
08x22,Unknown,Hey!
08x22,Unknown,You just won 300 bucks!
08x22,Unknown,"I just lost $5,000."
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, right. 'Cause the chicken."
08x22,Unknown,"Yep, that-that's"
08x22,Unknown,"$5,000, yeah."
08x22,Unknown,(laughs)
08x22,Unknown,"See, I'm laughing because you couldn't see me take my top off, but I just saw you lose your shirt. Hey-yo!"
08x22,Unknown,(horn honks)
08x22,Unknown,We have to go back.
08x22,(sneezes),"Loser! Sorry, that was a real sneeze."
08x22,Unknown,Might have made you miss what I was saying.
08x22,Unknown,Loser!
08x22,(laughs),Loser.
08x22,Unknown,We're not going anywhere.
08x22,Unknown,I can still make this night legendary.
08x22,Unknown,"Uh, uh... (speaks Chinese)"
08x22,Unknown,(replies in Chinese)
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, oh."
08x22,Unknown,"Okay, I got some credit."
08x22,Unknown,I just... mm...
08x22,Unknown,"Marshall, stand over there for good luck?"
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, sure."
08x22,Unknown,"Okay, okay."
08x22,Unknown,(crowd chants in Chinese)
08x22,Unknown,(speaks Chinese)
08x22,Unknown,(crowd cheers)
08x22,(laughs),Oh! Oh!
08x22,Unknown,"You crazy son of a b*tch, you did it!"
08x22,Unknown,"I just lost $80,000."
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, right, right, yeah. 'Cause the black jelly bean."
08x22,Unknown,"That-That's $80,000. He's right."
08x22,Unknown,(clears throat)
08x22,Unknown,"You know, Ralph, earlier at the salon, I waxed on, then waxed off."
08x22,(whispers),Everywhere.
08x22,Unknown,"Uh, listen, lady, your husband is, like..."
08x22,Unknown,"Hey, where"
08x22,Unknown,is
08x22,Unknown,your husband?
08x22,Unknown,Marshall?
08x22,Unknown,Where's Marshall?!
08x22,Unknown,"Okay, Lily, don't overreact, but..."
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, oh."
08x22,Unknown,"Okay, I got some credit."
08x22,Unknown,"Marshall, stand over there for good luck?"
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, sure."
08x22,Unknown,You sold my husband?!
08x22,Unknown,"Lily, can you be more like the Chinese mobster and give me some credit?"
08x22,Unknown,I'm going back for Marshall; I just need to get some money.
08x22,Unknown,"You have nothing to worry about; these are the ""good"" mobsters."
08x22,Unknown,"Wow, what kind of bozo does that to a friend?"
08x22,Unknown,"Shut it, Ralph Macchio!"
08x22,Unknown,"No, you shut it!"
08x22,Unknown,"Ralph Macchio's right, you"
08x22,Unknown,are
08x22,Unknown,a bozo.
08x22,Unknown,"Um, I think they prefer ""people of bright color."""
08x22,Unknown,You know what a bachelor party's about?
08x22,Unknown,Hanging out with your friends and having a good time.
08x22,Unknown,"But you only care about the good time, not the friends."
08x22,Unknown,So you know what?
08x22,Unknown,I'm-I'm done caring about you then.
08x22,Unknown,I'm out of here.
08x22,Unknown,Ted...
08x22,Unknown,"Ted, Ted, I have..."
08x22,Unknown,I just tore your mom away from a living version of a Nick Nolte mug shot and put her in a cab home.
08x22,Unknown,Thank you for abandoning me on what has been one of the worst nights of my life.
08x22,Unknown,"So, it's my usual fee, plus I always charge an extra hundred for girl-on-clown action."
08x22,Unknown,What the hell is she doing here?
08x22,Unknown,"Robin, I swear, nothing happened."
08x22,Unknown,That means just hand stuff.
08x22,Unknown,(horn honks)
08x22,Unknown,You...! Oh!
08x22,Unknown,"No, no, stop, stop, stop!"
08x22,Unknown,"Sorry, Barney, this... this-this is unforgivable."
08x22,Unknown,It's over.
08x22,Unknown,You know...
08x22,Unknown,I never got to do that.
08x22,Unknown,(sighs)
08x22,Unknown,(sighs)
08x22,Unknown,Ted?
08x22,Unknown,Robin.
08x22,Unknown,We're right on schedule.
08x22,Unknown,"Barney is suicidal. I know, it's awesome!"
08x22,Unknown,(both laughing)
08x22,Unknown,Narrator
08x22,Unknown,"Yep, kids, we had planned out every step of the night."
08x22,Unknown,It started three weeks earlier.
08x22,Unknown,...and you will disappoint me.
08x22,Unknown,"But make it great, okay?"
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, it'll be great, all right!"
08x22,Unknown,"Okay, after two weeks of brainstorming, all I have on my list so far is Purell."
08x22,Unknown,"Marshall, what do you got?"
08x22,Unknown,"Well, nothing"
08x22,Unknown,now.
08x22,Unknown,This is impossible!
08x22,Unknown,How do you make something memorable for a guy who makes every night the best night of his life?
08x22,Unknown,Give him the worst night of his life.
08x22,Unknown,We'll give him the worst hotel room
08x22,Unknown,"with the worst entertainment,"
08x22,Unknown,(horn honks)
08x22,Unknown,"the wrong Karate Kid,"
08x22,Unknown,and the absolute last stripper he would want to see.
08x22,Unknown,Hold on.
08x22,Unknown,You want me to pretend my life's gone to crap and I'm back to stripping just screw with my ex-fiancé?
08x22,Unknown,I love it!
08x22,Unknown,"That party will be so terrible, he'll have to leave it."
08x22,Unknown,Then I'll instruct his arch-nemesis to say...
08x22,Unknown,"I mean, what kind of loser has his bachelor party ten yards from A.C. and doesn't even gamble?"
08x22,Unknown,Robin
08x22,Unknown,Barney will take the envelope of cash I gave him and head straight into our trap.
08x22,Unknown,Hold on.
08x22,Unknown,You want us to rig a casino game to trick one of our former high rollers?
08x22,Unknown,Um...
08x22,Unknown,I love it.
08x22,Unknown,"Well, then you get Barney to use one of these guys as collateral."
08x22,Unknown,He'll probably choose me. What?
08x22,Unknown,"Well, I'd be worth more."
08x22,Unknown,Yeah. Perfect teeth.
08x22,Unknown,(clears throat)
08x22,Unknown,"Yeah, it's just, uh, just I'm"
08x22,Unknown,way
08x22,Unknown,more athletic than you.
08x22,Unknown,"Yeah, this coming from the guy who's never beaten me at skee-ball."
08x22,Unknown,"The only reason a mobster might choose you is because they'd be afraid I'd go all ""Marshall Unchained"" on them, which obviously isn't a risk with you."
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, you want to see some ""Ted Unchained,"" huh?"
08x22,Unknown,I'll show you Ted Unchained!
08x22,Unknown,"Marshall, would you mind standing over there for good luck?"
08x22,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, sure."
08x22,Unknown,Robin
08x22,Unknown,"Meanwhile, I'll make sure"
08x22,Unknown,he's abandoned me in my nightmare scenario.
08x22,Unknown,Hold on. You want me to help you trick my own son?
08x22,Unknown,I love it.
08x22,Unknown,(sighs)
08x22,Unknown,Barney deserves it.
08x22,Unknown,"You know, he told me you were a virgin."
08x22,Unknown,(scoffs)
08x22,Unknown,Ridiculous!
08x22,Unknown,I know.
08x22,Unknown,(laughs)
08x22,Unknown,You are a dirty ho-bag just like me.
08x22,Unknown,But he loves you so much.
08x22,Unknown,And so do I.
08x22,Unknown,(mouthing)
08x22,Unknown,"Wait, hold on. Is there any chance this is all too mean to Barney?"
08x22,Unknown,(laughter)
08x22,Unknown,Just kidding.
08x22,Unknown,"Okay, we just need the finale."
08x22,Unknown,Oh! The Chinese mobsters chop off my hand right in front of Barney!
08x22,Unknown,"Yes, we're all equally enthused!"
08x22,Unknown,"Okay, here's the plan. After I storm off..."
08x22,Unknown,Marshall
08x22,,Barney!
08x22,Unknown,"Barney, hurry! Give them the money!"
08x22,Unknown,"Please, hurry! Oh, no!"
08x22,Unknown,"The Chinese mobster is giving Marshall back and taking me hostage instead, because he says I'm obviously more valuable!"
08x22,Unknown,"Can you, can you unlock the door?"
08x22,Unknown,"Barney, please!"
08x22,Unknown,They're gonna chop off my hand!
08x22,Unknown,"No, they're not!"
08x22,Unknown,"They said you're free, and I think we agreed that's not something mobsters would do."
08x22,Unknown,"Ted, come on! This is my thing!"
08x22,Unknown,Don't hurt him.
08x22,Unknown,I've got the money.
08x22,Unknown,Too late!
08x22,Unknown,(screaming)
08x22,Unknown,Not my skee-ball hand!
08x22,Unknown,No...! No...!
08x22,Unknown,No!
08x22,Unknown,"Please, just don't sh**t me in the face... or the crotch!"
08x22,Unknown,All
08x22,,Surprise!
08x22,Unknown,What's going on?
08x22,Unknown,"Well, we decided to give you everything you wanted for your bachelor party without you even realizing it."
08x22,Unknown,"Wait, so that's why you made me think Marshall might die?"
08x22,Unknown,And I'd lost all that money and my friends hated me and my wedding was off?
08x22,Unknown,You just decided to-to check off everything on this list in the most twisted way imaginable?
08x22,Unknown,That is awesome!
08x22,Unknown,And it was all planned by a girl.
08x22,(laughs),Wow!
08x22,Unknown,"So, Lily... later on tonight, you want to, um...?"
08x22,Unknown,"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
08x22,Unknown,That was all just part of the act.
08x22,Unknown,"Y-You knew that, right?"
08x22,Unknown,Yeah! Totally.
08x22,Unknown,"We pulled it off, right?"
08x22,Unknown,Platonic shake!
08x22,Unknown,"Everyone, everyone, thank you for an incredible bro mitzvah."
08x22,Unknown,Mazel brov!
08x22,Unknown,All
08x22,,Mazel brov!
08x22,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x22,Unknown,"Mm, oh, you didn't really get everything on the list."
08x22,Unknown,"N-No offense to Ralph Macchio, but he ain't the Karate Kid."
08x22,Unknown,I couldn't agree with you more.
08x22,Unknown,"You know, they almost didn't get me."
08x22,Unknown,But after
08x22,Unknown,18 voice mails...
08x22,Unknown,I returned Robin's call.
08x22,Unknown,And she told me how you're one of the few people in the world who truly gets
08x22,Unknown,The Karate Kid
08x22,Unknown,movie.
08x22,Unknown,"So when she asked if I'd help, well, my answer just had to be..."
08x22,Unknown,Hai!
08x22,Unknown,William Zabka!
08x22,Unknown,(all cheering)
08x23,Unknown,Narrator
08x23,Unknown,"In 1994, Robin's dad took her to New York City for the first time..."
08x23,Unknown,"This is amazing! Thank you, sir!"
08x23,Unknown,"Well, a little father-son bonding trip never hurt anyone."
08x23,Unknown,I-I did almost die from malnutrition on that wolf hunt last year...
08x23,Unknown,I had to almost k*ll you for you to learn how to k*ll.
08x23,Unknown,(sighs happily)
08x23,Unknown,"New York City's the best, eh?"
08x23,Unknown,"I despise it. It's like Edmonton, minus the arts and culture."
08x23,Unknown,"Come on, we'll miss our flight."
08x23,Unknown,I'll catch up.
08x23,Unknown,"One day, I'm gonna move here, marry a sophisticated big-city man with a sick mullet--"
08x23,Unknown,"like all the way down to his shoulder pads, and at night, he'll let me brush it... and I'll dig up this locket so it can be my ""something old"" at our wedding."
08x23,ROBIN SENIOR,R.J.!
08x23,Unknown,"Coming, sir!"
08x23,(whispering),I'll be back for you.
08x23,Unknown,"Back then, I was-I was too embarrassed to tell you why I've done that, but we're closer now."
08x23,Unknown,(phone ringing)
08x23,Unknown,I feel like I don't have to hide my feminine side anymore just because you've always wanted a...
08x23,Unknown,Son! It's Barney!
08x23,Unknown,Great!
08x23,Unknown,"I'll be there in 15, B-dawg."
08x23,Unknown,"Woof, woof!"
08x23,Unknown,(laughs)
08x23,Unknown,That's our thing.
08x23,Unknown,Uh... be where in 15?
08x23,Unknown,Laser tag.
08x23,Unknown,Never been. B-dawg's gonna teach me.
08x23,Unknown,"Look, I-I think that it's great that you and Barney are..."
08x23,Unknown,B-dawg.
08x23,Unknown,"...B-dawg are bonding, but, um... you agreed to help me with this."
08x23,Unknown,Fine.
08x23,Unknown,Where did you bury this tampon?
08x23,Unknown,It's a locket.
08x23,Unknown,"I'm sorry, I get all these girlie things confused."
08x23,Unknown,Do you need my help or not?
08x23,Unknown,"Nah, it's stupid."
08x23,Unknown,(laughs)
08x23,Unknown,Narrator
08x23,Unknown,Lily's year-long art consultant
08x23,Unknown,gig in Italy.
08x23,Unknown,I still can't believe we have to say goodbye to this place...
08x23,Unknown,"Oh. I know, baby."
08x23,Unknown,But look at it as an excuse to simplify our lives.
08x23,Unknown,"You know, we can't bring everything to Italy, so we gotta throw out some junk."
08x23,Unknown,"For example, look... my old Sasquatch binders that ""I could never throw away"""
08x23,Unknown,"because ""I was gonna be the guy who proved the existence of Bigfoot..."""
08x23,Unknown,These are obviously coming to Italy.
08x23,Unknown,But these handbags?
08x23,Unknown,Gonzo.
08x23,Unknown,No way!
08x23,Unknown,These have sentimental meaning to me.
08x23,Unknown,Didn't you shop-lift these in your 20s?
08x23,Unknown,"Yes, and I get very nostalgic for that time."
08x23,Unknown,"You get older, you have kids, you stop stealing, it's sad."
08x23,Unknown,Lily... we just don't have room for these.
08x23,Unknown,"Oh, but you get to keep your Bigfoot binders?"
08x23,Unknown,"Wait, why is this one just December 1999?"
08x23,Unknown,Oh. Y2K was coming.
08x23,Unknown,Lot of people took to the woods.
08x23,Unknown,Saw the truth.
08x23,Unknown,"Okay, Marshall, we don't have time to argue over what stays and what goes."
08x23,Unknown,"Ooh, you know who we gotta bring in?"
08x23,Unknown,"Okay, I agree he is good at this stuff, but he just gets so cocky."
08x23,Unknown,"No, he doesn't."
08x23,Unknown,So I heard you guys have a bit of a... packing situation.
08x23,Unknown,I acknowledge now this was a mistake.
08x23,Unknown,"Look, I came here to chew bubblegum and pack boxes."
08x23,Unknown,And I'm all out of bubble...
08x23,Unknown,"(gulps, chokes)"
08x23,(coughing),"Oh, my God.... Oh, my God."
08x23,Unknown,I swallowed it.
08x23,Unknown,Is that bad?
08x23,Unknown,"Okay, thank you."
08x23,Unknown,"Well, Dr. Goldsmith says I should be fine."
08x23,Unknown,I just have to look for it in my stool.
08x23,Unknown,So as I was saying...
08x23,Unknown,I heard you guys have a bit of a... packing situation.

08x23,Unknown,Um...

08x23,Unknown,I... um...
08x23,Unknown,"Ted, if this chair really means that much to you, why don't you just take it for yourself?"
08x23,Unknown,"No, it's important that you keep it."
08x23,Unknown,Why?
08x23,Unknown,This is the first thing we bought when we moved here after college.

08x23,Unknown,That could never happen.
08x23,Unknown,"You're not a chair, you're our best friend."
08x23,Unknown,"You can say that, but a lot can change in a year."
08x23,Unknown,"Buddy, I..."
08x23,Unknown,"Look, I know I'm being crazy."
08x23,Unknown,I just...
08x23,Unknown,I just need a moment with this chair.
08x23,Unknown,You know... to say good-bye.
08x23,Unknown,We'll give you two some space.

08x23,Unknown,"Uh, what kind of issue?"
08x23,Unknown,"Actually, it's a long story..."
08x23,Unknown,"Um, Robin, listen, I'm-I'm late for a big meeting."
08x23,Unknown,Is it important?
08x23,Unknown,"Nah, it's stupid."
08x23,Unknown,Good luck.
08x23,Unknown,"All right, here's the bottom line, cockroaches."
08x23,Unknown,There's no end in sight and we've got no provisions.
08x23,Unknown,"If it comes down to it, I need a volunteer to let the rest of us... eat him."
08x23,Unknown,Barney's team seems way more fun.
08x23,Unknown,Nonsense.
08x23,Unknown,Candy for everyone!
08x23,Unknown,(kids whooping)
08x23,Unknown,"Okay, Team Animal House... who wants to try a cigar?"
08x23,Unknown,Yeah! Yay! (laughs)
08x23,Unknown,"I'm not saying we're gonna start with your face or anything, but is there seriously no one here willing to give up a hand or a foot?"
08x23,Unknown,We're outta here!
08x23,Unknown,"Ted, why are you here?"
08x23,Unknown,You had that meeting; I told you not to come.
08x23,Unknown,"You said, ""Nah, it's stupid,"""
08x23,Unknown,"which is Robin-ese for, ""It's important."""
08x23,Unknown,Everyone knows that.
08x23,Unknown,Well... not everyone.
08x23,Unknown,But you shouldn't have skipped that meeting.
08x23,Unknown,Was it important?
08x23,Unknown,"Nah, it's stupid."
08x23,Unknown,"And yet, my future husband--"
08x23,Unknown,who I sometimes fear is troublingly similar to my emotionally unavailable father--
08x23,"is off sh**ting laser g*ns with, oh, yeah, you guessed it",my emotionally unavailable father.
08x23,Unknown,"Oh, come on, that's not fair."
08x23,Unknown,"If you told Barney that you needed him, he'd be here in a heartbeat."
08x23,Unknown,I didn't have to tell you.
08x23,Unknown,And you're here.
08x23,Unknown,You don't even know why.

08x23,Unknown,"Long story short, I promised my future self the locket would be my ""something old"" at my wedding."
08x23,Unknown,What?
08x23,Unknown,"No, I just like that there was ever a version of you who imagined having a ""something old"" at your wedding."
08x23,Unknown,Robin Scherbatsky--
08x23,Unknown,you're a girl.
08x23,Unknown,Shut up.
08x23,Unknown,You're
08x23,Unknown,a girl.
08x23,Unknown,That's been established.
08x23,Unknown,The new information here is that
08x23,Unknown,you're
08x23,Unknown,a girl.
08x23,Unknown,Wait... is that...?
08x23,Unknown,"Oh, my God, I found it."
08x23,Unknown,"(sighs, laughs)"
08x23,Unknown,Okay... what's really going on with this locket?
08x23,Unknown,(sighs)
08x23,Unknown,I'm gonna admit something that I couldn't admit until I found this.
08x23,Unknown,I've been having fears about marrying Barney.
08x23,Unknown,"I mean, in many ways, he's-he's grown up into a mature, caring adult..."
08x23,Unknown,I'm gonna sh**t you with your own g*n.
08x23,Unknown,(laughs manically)
08x23,Unknown,...but I still don't know if he's ready for this.
08x23,Unknown,I still don't know if I am.
08x23,Unknown,But if I could find this locket--
08x23,Unknown,"if it was still here, waiting for me--"
08x23,Unknown,that would mean that the Universe wanted me to marry Barney.
08x23,Unknown,And that everything was gonna be okay.
08x23,Unknown,"And when it was gone, it was like... every doubt I-I ever had about Barney, about myself, got dug up."
08x23,Unknown,But I found it. (laughs)
08x23,Unknown,And everything's gonna be okay.
08x23,Unknown,Any last words?
08x23,Unknown,"You know, seeing you on the field of battle--"
08x23,Unknown,"ruthless, manipulative, untrustworthy--"
08x23,Unknown,you've got all the qualities I would've wanted in a son.
08x23,Now I say to you the last words my father said to me,"""sh**t me already."""
08x23,Unknown,"Or we could keep playing, if you want."
08x23,Unknown,"Nah, it's stupid."
08x23,Unknown,"Okay, Team Animal House, I got him!"
08x23,Unknown,Come on out!

08x23,Unknown,This is a sign from the Universe.
08x23,Unknown,It's not a sign from the Universe...
08x23,Unknown,"Yes, it is!"
08x23,Unknown,The-the locket is just gone and you're telling me that doesn't mean anything?
08x23,Unknown,"You know this is a bad omen, Ted-- you're Universe Guy!"
08x23,Unknown,And you're Skeptic Girl!
08x23,Unknown,You're-you're not supposed to believe any of that.
08x23,Unknown,"Well, maybe I've grown skeptical of being skeptical."
08x23,(voice breaking),This is a sign.
08x23,Unknown,"Look, it's not a sign."
08x23,Unknown,You're doing the right thing marrying Barney.
08x23,Unknown,The Universe isn't sending you some message.
08x23,Unknown,(thunder crashes)
08x23,Unknown,"As we know from science, rain is liquid water in the form of droplets which have condensed from atmospheric vapor and then precipitated."
08x23,Unknown,It's not a sign.

08x23,Unknown,"I mean, the Universe is screaming at me right now!"
08x23,Unknown,"How-how-how can you, of all people, tell me to ignore that?"
08x23,Unknown,"Because maybe it's dumb to look for ""signs from the Universe."""
08x23,Unknown,"I mean, maybe the Universe has better things to do."
08x23,Unknown,"Dear God, I hope it does."
08x23,Unknown,"Do you know how many ""signs"" I've gotten that I should or shouldn't be with someone?"
08x23,Unknown,And where has it gotten me?
08x23,Unknown,Maybe there aren't any signs.
08x23,Unknown,"Maybe... maybe a locket's just a locket, a chair is just a chair."
08x23,Unknown,Maybe we don't have to give meaning to every little thing.
08x23,Unknown,Maybe we don't... maybe we don't need the Universe to tell us what we really want.
08x23,Unknown,"Maybe we already know that, deep down."

08x24,Unknown,"Original Air Date on May 13, 2013"
08x24,Unknown,You didn't tell your mom about Rome?
08x24,Unknown,It didn't feel right.
08x24,Unknown,This isn't over-the-phone news.
08x24,Unknown,This is face-to-face news.
08x24,Unknown,I was gonna tell her when we see her at Christmas.
08x24,Unknown,You were gonna wait and tell her after we had already been living there for six months?
08x24,Unknown,That... was a great plan.
08x24,Unknown,Damn it.
08x24,Unknown,"Hey, Mom, it's Marshall."
08x24,Unknown,"If you're moving to Rome, I at least need to see my grandson before you go!"
08x24,Unknown,"Of course, and that is why we would love for you to come visit us for a week."
08x24,Unknown,No.
08x24,Unknown,The place will be all packed up.
08x24,"Oh, oh, uh, okay, hey, Mom, better idea",how about we all come visit you for a week?
08x24,Unknown,I can't go to Minnesota for a week.
08x24,Unknown,I have a job.
08x24,"Okay, Mom, here's the plan","um, Lily has to work, so Marvin and I will come visit you for a whole week, and I-I'll see if I can get a last-minute flight."
08x24,Unknown,You are going to take my infant son away from me for a whole week?
08x24,Unknown,Whoo!
08x24,Unknown,"So, what do you want to do tonight--"
08x24,Unknown,"drink ourselves blind, set a car on fire?"
08x24,Unknown,"(gasps) Ooh, watch a movie that doesn't start with a desk lamp jumping on top of a capital ""I""?"
08x24,Unknown,"I'm all yours, Teddy Westside."
08x24,Unknown,"Actually, tonight it's Teddy Westchester."
08x24,Unknown,"Got to head up to the house, take care of some stuff."
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, yeah, how's the restoration going?"
08x24,Unknown,"Actually, done."
08x24,Unknown,You finished the house?
08x24,Unknown,"Well, I want to see it."
08x24,Unknown,"Marshall already canceled the cable, huh?"
08x24,Unknown,And the Wi-Fi. It's like
08x24,Unknown,Little House on the Freaking Prairie
08x24,Unknown,up there.
08x24,Unknown,Mm-hmm.
08x24,Unknown,"Well, the wedding planning is done, so tonight is all about relaxing and celebrating everything that makes us awesome, which is why I requested our favorite table."
08x24,Unknown,The one by the window.
08x24,Unknown,Where we were sitting the night we saw those two bums fighting.
08x24,Unknown,Both
08x24,,Over a sandwich.
08x24,Unknown,(both laughing)
08x24,Unknown,We almost called the cops.
08x24,Unknown,(sighs)
08x24,Unknown,And then we realized they weren't fighting at all.
08x24,Unknown,They were making love.
08x24,Unknown,(sighs)
08x24,Unknown,Over a sandwich.
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, I almost forgot."
08x24,Unknown,(gasps)
08x24,Unknown,"Ha-ha, yeah. No way, is that...?"
08x24,Unknown,El Piramide.
08x24,Unknown,The first cigar we ever smoked together.
08x24,Unknown,"Aw, Barney."
08x24,Unknown,(chuckles)
08x24,Unknown,Woman
08x24,,Excuse me.
08x24,Unknown,Hi.
08x24,Unknown,Could you not? Thanks.
08x24,Unknown,"Uh... dude, I'm not gonna light 'em up in here."
08x24,Unknown,I'm just looking at 'em.
08x24,Unknown,"Right, but even when they're unlit, the smell-- it's very..."
08x24,Unknown,Pungent.
08x24,Unknown,Exactly--
08x24,Unknown,thank you.
08x24,Unknown,It's a very pungent smell.
08x24,Unknown,"So, could you not?"
08x24,Unknown,Thanks.
08x24,Unknown,Okay.
08x24,Unknown,(sighs)
08x24,Unknown,"I'm sorry, can you also put the bag away?"
08x24,Unknown,It-It's just really unappetizing to look at.
08x24,Unknown,You're unappetizing to look at.
08x24,Unknown,"You know what? Um, I'll put them away, okay?"
08x24,Unknown,Enjoy your night.
08x24,Unknown,We'll try.
08x24,Unknown,Did those two just become our archenemies?
08x24,Unknown,"No, Robin, they've always been our archenemies."
08x24,Unknown,They've only just revealed themselves.
08x24,Unknown,"Hi, Kristen?"
08x24,Unknown,Everyone pronounces it wrong.
08x24,Unknown,(groans)
08x24,Unknown,"The ""R"" is after the ""I"""""
08x24,Unknown,Kirsten.
08x24,Unknown,"And before the ""I"""""
08x24,Unknown,(sighs)
08x24,Unknown,It's Krirsten.
08x24,Unknown,Your table's ready.
08x24,Unknown,"Wow, they're ""trerrible"""""
08x24,Unknown,You know what?
08x24,Unknown,"Don't even think about them, okay?"
08x24,Unknown,"Tonight is about celebrating us. You're right, you're right."
08x24,We shouldn't let a couple... MAN,"Nope, nope."
08x24,Unknown,I'm a self-diagnosed claustrophobic.
08x24,Unknown,I have to sit next to the window.
08x24,Unknown,"No, that's our table, that's our table, that's our table, that's our table, that's our table, that's our table."
08x24,Unknown,(groans)
08x24,Unknown,You know what?
08x24,Unknown,Screw celebrating us. You know what we're gonna do?
08x24,Unknown,Both
08x24,,"Make those smug, obnoxious sons of b*tches pay."
08x24,Unknown,Aw...
08x24,Unknown,(both giggle)
08x24,Unknown,Narrator
08x24,Unknown,So Aunt Lily and I drove up to Westchester.
08x24,Unknown,(phone rings)
08x24,Unknown,"Hey, baby, how's Minnesota?"
08x24,Unknown,Marshall
08x24,,It is so much fun.
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, hold on one sec."
08x24,Unknown,"Marshall, I made you this welcome-home ice cream sundae."
08x24,Unknown,"But I can't remember, do you like crushed nuts?"
08x24,Unknown,Marshall
08x24,,I love crushed nuts.
08x24,Unknown,Oh!
08x24,Unknown,"Anyway, it's, it's great to be home."
08x24,Unknown,How's Judy doing?
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, she's great."
08x24,Unknown,"It's cute, you know, she keeps joking about how she's not gonna let us leave."
08x24,Unknown,I'm really not.
08x24,Unknown,It's not a joke.
08x24,Unknown,(laughing)
08x24,Unknown,(all laughing)
08x24,Unknown,Judy's going to talk him out of going to Rome.
08x24,Unknown,"I knew something was going to screw up our plans, and this is it."
08x24,Unknown,She is going to convince him never to leave the country.
08x24,Unknown,I think you're imagining things.
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, yeah? Well, check out what's already on Facebook."
08x24,Unknown,Inconclusive.
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, really?"
08x24,Unknown,It's getting conclusiver.
08x24,Unknown,"Hey, Lily."
08x24,Unknown,What? Come on.
08x24,Unknown,"Okay, open 'em."
08x24,Unknown,"Your eyes-- sorry, they should have been closed."
08x24,Unknown,That one's on me.
08x24,Unknown,Let's try again.
08x24,Unknown,Wow.
08x24,Unknown,"Ted, you did this all yourself?"
08x24,Unknown,Just like Ryan Gosling in
08x24,Unknown,The Notebook.
08x24,Unknown,I was pretty manly till I mentioned Ryan Gosling in
08x24,Unknown,"The Notebook,"
08x24,Unknown,huh?
08x24,Unknown,"Even I haven't seen it, Ted."
08x24,Unknown,"Just think, this is the house your kids are going to grow up in."
08x24,Unknown,They are going to roast marshmallows in this fireplace.
08x24,Unknown,They're gonna experiment with recreational dr*gs on that porch.
08x24,Unknown,They're gonna sit on a couch right here and listen to your boring stories about...
08x24,Unknown,"""For sale"" sign?"
08x24,Unknown,Are you selling this place?
08x24,Unknown,Yeah.
08x24,Unknown,Why?
08x24,Unknown,Because I'm moving to Chicago.
08x24,Unknown,Ow.
08x24,Unknown,"So, what are we gonna do--"
08x24,Unknown,"put something in their food, key their car? Ooh, do either of those cigars explode?"
08x24,Unknown,"Hold on, Wile E. Coyote, I think I got something."
08x24,Unknown,He's checking out the hostess.
08x24,Unknown,"Now, a guy who's happily in a relationship sees a girl like that, he'll check her out maybe 14, 15 times, tops."
08x24,Unknown,"16 times, tops."
08x24,Unknown,So Krirsten's more invested in the relationship than her fella is.
08x24,Unknown,That could spell trouble.
08x24,Unknown,Challenge accepted.
08x24,Unknown,"Hey, do you think it's bad luck for a bride to break up two strangers a week before her wedding?"
08x24,Unknown,I'd say it's very bad luck... for Krirsten.
08x24,Unknown,(both laughing)
08x24,Unknown,"Ow, I hate this table so much!"
08x24,Unknown,Why would you move to Chicago?
08x24,Unknown,Because it's the perfect town for me.
08x24,Unknown,"I-It's like a Clevelandy New York, and-- don't act like you haven't noticed--"
08x24,Unknown,my hair excels in the wind.
08x24,Unknown,"Besides, you're moving to Rome."
08x24,Unknown,"Yeah, for a year, a-and when we get back, we need you to be here waiting for us, hopefully living in this house with your future bride."
08x24,Unknown,Wha... what future bride?
08x24,Unknown,The girl.
08x24,Unknown,"She's out there walking around New York City right now, probably in a pair of really cute boots that she's gonna let me borrow whenever I want because we're the same size."
08x24,Unknown,"She is out there, Ted."
08x24,Unknown,"Is she, really? Because I've looked."
08x24,Unknown,I have looked high and low for someone I can love and adore and cook waffles for.
08x24,Unknown,The closest I've come is Marshall.
08x24,Unknown,He does love your waffles.
08x24,Unknown,It's the cinnamon.
08x24,Unknown,I add cinnamon.
08x24,Unknown,She's not in New York.
08x24,Unknown,Maybe she's in Chicago.
08x24,Unknown,(phone rings)
08x24,Unknown,"Okay, you are being ridiculous."
08x24,Unknown,You are going to find someone here in New York that you love just as much as I love Marshall.
08x24,Unknown,"And you, if you let Judy talk you out of going to Italy, so help me, I will never let you stuff my ravioli again."
08x24,Unknown,I'm gonna take you off speaker.
08x24,Unknown,"Lily, you got to relax."
08x24,Unknown,"Okay, my mom is psyched about Italy."
08x24,Unknown,She keeps making jokes about how she's gonna come live with us in Rome and sleep on the couch and cook every meal for us so we never have to go to a restaurant the whole year we're there.
08x24,Unknown,It's not a joke.
08x24,Unknown,"By not saying no to me right now, you are giving me your full consent for that to happen."
08x24,Unknown,(laughs)
08x24,Unknown,(laughing and mumbling)
08x24,Unknown,(forced laugh)
08x24,Unknown,I got to go.
08x24,Unknown,Barney
08x24,,"""I'm probably saying some political stuff right now to sound smart."""
08x24,Unknown,"""I'm probably referring to some snooty podcast to sound even smarter."""
08x24,Unknown,"""I'm probably saying something in French."""
08x24,Unknown,Aah!
08x24,Unknown,My God...
08x24,Unknown,Ow.
08x24,Unknown,"Okay, you want to break them up?"
08x24,Unknown,I got a plan.
08x24,Unknown,"It's something I know has worked in the past, but it-it's, it's risky, so it's, it's not too late to call it off."
08x24,Unknown,"No way, I'm in."
08x24,Unknown,"Good, 'cause it's too late to call it off."
08x24,Unknown,Observe.
08x24,Unknown,And that is why the senate can't push anything through.
08x24,Unknown,And Doug Mand said the same thing in his podcast.
08x24,Unknown,"It's like, ""Après moi le déluge!"""
08x24,Unknown,(laughing)
08x24,Unknown,Ooh.
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh."
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh."
08x24,Unknown,"Yes, yes, yes."
08x24,Unknown,Yes!
08x24,Unknown,Man
08x24,,What?
08x24,Unknown,KRIRSTEN
08x24,,Yes!
08x24,Unknown,I will marry you!
08x24,Unknown,(chuckles) Even though a ring in a champagne glass is a total cliché
08x24,Unknown,and this is a cushion cut.
08x24,Unknown,And how long have I been hinting that I want a princess cut?
08x24,Unknown,But yes!
08x24,Unknown,That's a mistake. That's not from me.
08x24,Unknown,It's not?
08x24,Unknown,We've only been together seven years.
08x24,Unknown,Now it becomes clear. Here we go.
08x24,Unknown,You want commitment the same way you want my brother to work for you.
08x24,Unknown,I'm sorry I didn't put an engagement ring in your drink.
08x24,Unknown,"The way you chug booze, I'm surprised you even noticed."
08x24,Unknown,"So, when are you leaving?"
08x24,Unknown,Day after the wedding.
08x24,Unknown,What?
08x24,Unknown,You can't miss the day after the wedding.
08x24,Unknown,"That's when we sit around all hungover, drinking mimosas and talking smack about who looked fat."
08x24,Unknown,That's my Christmas.
08x24,Unknown,Why are you in such a rush to get out of there?
08x24,Unknown,Oh.
08x24,Unknown,Of course.
08x24,Unknown,You're not leaving because you think the love of your life isn't in New York.
08x24,Unknown,You're leaving because you think she is.
08x24,Unknown,"And this time next week, she'll be married to your best friend."
08x24,Unknown,(phone rings)
08x24,Unknown,(sighs) Baby!
08x24,Unknown,I am in the middle of something super dramatic here.
08x24,But real quick,"If you let Judy come to Rome with us, you are going to have to find someone else to do your laundry and massage your feet."
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, my gosh, she's going to do all that, won't she?"
08x24,Unknown,"Lily, you have to stop freaking out."
08x24,Unknown,Nothing is going to screw up the plan.
08x24,Unknown,We're doing this.
08x24,Unknown,I love you.
08x24,Unknown,"I love you, baby. Bye."
08x24,Unknown,(phone rings)
08x24,Unknown,Hello?
08x24,Unknown,Hi. Marshall Eriksen?
08x24,Unknown,I'm calling from the New York State Judiciary Committee.
08x24,Unknown,"Uh, you applied for a judgeship a few months ago, remember?"
08x24,Unknown,"Uh, of... of course."
08x24,Unknown,"Well, I have good news."
08x24,Unknown,We have a last-minute opening on the bench.
08x24,Unknown,What are you saying to me right now?
08x24,Unknown,I'm saying congratulations.
08x24,Unknown,We want you to be a judge.
08x24,Unknown,"So, you want me to be a judge? Yes."
08x24,Unknown,And I would start a week from Tuesday? Yes.
08x24,Unknown,Could I maybe start a year from Tuesday?
08x24,Unknown,No.
08x24,Unknown,Got to be a week from Tuesday? Yes.
08x24,Unknown,And I'd be a real judge? Yes.
08x24,Unknown,With a robe? Yes.
08x24,Unknown,Gavel? Yes.
08x24,Unknown,Wacky Southern accent? No.
08x24,(bad Southern accent),"Now, counselor, are you absolutely sure?"
08x24,Unknown,Yes.
08x24,Unknown,And I have to be in New York for this?
08x24,Unknown,Yes. I can't telecommute?
08x24,Unknown,No.
08x24,Unknown,I couldn't be the crazy speakerphone judge?
08x24,Unknown,No. Could I be a hologram?
08x24,Unknown,No. Animatronic robot like Abe Lincoln from the Hall of Presidents that I control from afar with a joystick?
08x24,Unknown,No.
08x24,Unknown,Do you remember the giant Jor-El head from
08x24,Unknown,Superman?
08x24,Unknown,"Yes. Well, what if I...?"
08x24,Unknown,No. Is there any way that I could do this and also spend the next year of my life in Italy with my wife? No.
08x24,Unknown,This is such a big decision.
08x24,Unknown,I-I'm not good at big decisions.
08x24,Unknown,Are you sure you want to be a judge?
08x24,Unknown,"Wow. Now that we've broken up a seven-year relationship just 'cause they stole our table, I feel kind of... Awesome?"
08x24,Unknown,"I was going to say horny, but yeah, awesome, too."
08x24,Unknown,(both laughing)
08x24,Unknown,No way.
08x24,Unknown,Are you kidding me? What?
08x24,Unknown,Barney
08x24,,Whoa. Is there going to be a fight?
08x24,Unknown,"Okay, here's the play."
08x24,Unknown,"You take the girl, and the guy and I will watch."
08x24,Unknown,Hello. Just the people we want to see.
08x24,Unknown,We got in a pretty big fight because of you guys.
08x24,Unknown,We had to call our therapists after hours.
08x24,Unknown,Not cool.
08x24,Unknown,"Anyway, it got us to where we are now."
08x24,Unknown,We're getting married!
08x24,Unknown,And I'm taking her last name.
08x24,Unknown,You should think about doing the same thing.
08x24,Unknown,"Well, good night. Good night."
08x24,Unknown,Good night. Congratulations.
08x24,Unknown,"Yes, definitely."
08x24,Unknown,That was us.
08x24,Unknown,We made that happen.
08x24,Unknown,We're pretty cool.
08x24,Unknown,"And, you know, a week from today, we are going to be legend... wait for it..."
08x24,Unknown,Married.
08x24,Unknown,Legend-married. Legend-married.
08x24,Unknown,(both laughing)
08x24,Unknown,"Robin Scherbatsky, I love you so damn much."
08x24,Unknown,"I love you, too, Barney Scherbatsky."
08x24,Unknown,That sounds good.
08x24,Unknown,Shh. Think about it.
08x24,Unknown,Ted
08x24,Unknown,They're happy.
08x24,Unknown,And I'm happy for them.
08x24,Unknown,I want them to have an amazing life together. I just...
08x24,Unknown,I just think it would be best for everyone if I wasn't around for it.
08x24,Unknown,Did something happen recently between you and Robin?
08x24,Unknown,No.
08x24,Unknown,"Where's the poop, Ted?"
08x24,Unknown,She called me up the other day.
08x24,Unknown,"She was trying to dig up this locket she had buried behind the Central Park Carousel, and I blew off that big interview to go help her."
08x24,Unknown,And then... it started raining.
08x24,Unknown,"I'll, uh..."
08x24,Unknown,I'll see you at the wedding.
08x24,Unknown,Yeah.
08x24,Unknown,Ted
08x24,Unknown,"Even now, after all these years,"
08x24,Unknown,"there's still just this part of me where, if there's even the slightest chance something I do could make Robin smile, I don't even think about it--"
08x24,Unknown,I just do it.
08x24,Unknown,"I mean, if I could make that locket magically appear, I would."
08x24,Unknown,"I would open a vein in my arm if I could bleed that locket out, just to make her happy."
08x24,Unknown,That's just a really sucky way to feel about your best friend's fiancée.
08x24,Unknown,"So I'm going to come to the wedding, you know, I'll have a good time, but after that, I..."
08x24,Unknown,What?
08x24,Unknown,(sighs)
08x24,Unknown,I know where the locket is.
08x24,Unknown,What?
08x24,Unknown,I know where the locket is.
08x24,Unknown,"It-it was a few years ago,"
08x24,Unknown,right before you were supposed to marry Stella.
08x24,Unknown,"I went down to the bar one night to get a drink, and what should I see?"
08x24,Unknown,Lily!
08x24,Unknown,"Hey, girl."
08x24,Unknown,I got a question for you.
08x24,Unknown,Why isn't Ted marrying me?
08x24,Unknown,Whoa...
08x24,Unknown,"I'm sorry. Oh, God."
08x24,Unknown,I'm sorry.
08x24,Unknown,"I just... I-I should be happy for him, and yet here I am, moving off to Japan just to get away from him."
08x24,Unknown,And-and I guess to see those... those terra-cotta warriors and the Great Wall.
08x24,Unknown,"Well, that's China."
08x24,Unknown,What? This?
08x24,Unknown,"No, it's just a paper plate."
08x24,Unknown,(plate shatters)
08x24,Unknown,"Uh, we should get out of here."
08x24,Unknown,"Come on. Come on. Oh, totally."
08x24,Unknown,I know just where we should go.
08x24,Unknown,"Man, you're fast when you're drunk."
08x24,Unknown,But at least you're still making good decisions.
08x24,Unknown,"Central Park, around midnight, digging a hole with a spoon."
08x24,Unknown,Solid.
08x24,Unknown,Jackpot. (sighs)
08x24,Unknown,What is that?
08x24,Unknown,My something old.
08x24,Unknown,This locket was my grandma's.
08x24,Unknown,She kept it hidden in her butt all through World w*r II.
08x24,Unknown,What? Where was she?
08x24,Unknown,Winnipeg.
08x24,Unknown,(laughing)
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, come on."
08x24,Unknown,"Lily, it's a joke."
08x24,Unknown,"Yeah, I was going to wear this when I married Ted."
08x24,Unknown,I guess that's not going to happen.
08x24,Unknown,So I am taking it with me to Japan.
08x24,Unknown,"Okay, Lily, help me put this locket in my butt."
08x24,Unknown,"Okay. Uh, you know what?"
08x24,Unknown,Why don't we put it in this pencil box instead?
08x24,Unknown,"Oh, and then I will take the pencil box with me to Japan."
08x24,Unknown,"Okay. Hey, Lily?"
08x24,Unknown,Help me put this pencil box in my butt.
08x24,Unknown,(laughing)
08x24,Unknown,Wait!
